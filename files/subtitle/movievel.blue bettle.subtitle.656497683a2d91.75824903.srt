0
00:01:51,053 --> 00:01:52,649
<i>And the mother cried,</i>

1
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:56,653
<i>"Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?"</i>

2
00:01:57,289 --> 00:01:59,020
<i>And the daughter said,</i>

3
00:01:59,155 --> 00:02:02,724
<i>"Is it me I
see, mirrored in yours?"</i>

4
00:03:03,253 --> 00:03:04,555
Helena.

5
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:07,393
Come back.

6
00:03:37,026 --> 00:03:40,388
She's going to make you do twice
as many chores when you get back.

7
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:43,124
I don't mind the trade.

8
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:46,267
Maybe if we're gone long enough,
she'll forget she's mad.

9
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,369
Okay.

10
00:03:50,436 --> 00:03:52,735
We'll walk slow, Little Shadow.

11
00:04:30,109 --> 00:04:31,138
It was here.

12
00:04:31,607 --> 00:04:33,072
Running or walking?

13
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:39,250
The strides are wider
than before.

14
00:04:39,385 --> 00:04:42,686
And deeper on the outsides.

15
00:04:48,226 --> 00:04:49,226
It was running.

16
00:04:49,292 --> 00:04:50,760
Why?

17
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:54,834
Because it was scared
of something.

18
00:04:54,969 --> 00:04:56,436
Scared of what?

19
00:04:59,335 --> 00:05:00,572
Us.

20
00:05:02,341 --> 00:05:04,907
If you were afraid,

21
00:05:05,943 --> 00:05:08,745
running for your life,
where would you go?

22
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:31,768
Where no one could see me.

23
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:12,479
It's time you finished the hunt.

24
00:06:23,753 --> 00:06:24,873
What if I miss?

25
00:06:24,952 --> 00:06:27,659
Then we go hungry tonight.

26
00:06:42,871 --> 00:06:44,742
I didn't make a sound.

27
00:06:46,644 --> 00:06:48,845
So, what do you think happened?

28
00:06:58,027 --> 00:06:59,053
It smelled me.

29
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:08,865
You won't need the fire.

30
00:07:18,712 --> 00:07:21,911
Helena,
come get what you earned today.

31
00:07:29,391 --> 00:07:31,450
She's always mad at me.

32
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:35,188
Oh, your mother
can't see happiness like we do.

33
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,497
Okay.

34
00:08:47,633 --> 00:08:48,932
I'm fine.

35
00:08:49,602 --> 00:08:51,000
It's getting late.

36
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,725
Helena, no more.

37
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:58,666
Where's the rest of it?

38
00:09:58,802 --> 00:10:00,172
It's free now.

39
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:04,710
It chewed its own leg off?

40
00:10:04,846 --> 00:10:07,747
Sacrificed what it had to,
to survive.

41
00:10:59,968 --> 00:11:01,965
When can I keep mine
in the house like you do?

42
00:11:02,101 --> 00:11:04,633
When you're as good a hunter
as I am.

43
00:11:04,769 --> 00:11:05,934
Which will be never.

44
00:11:11,072 --> 00:11:12,574
What do the marks say?

45
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:13,976
They say,

46
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,145
"When you're running
from an angry moose,

47
00:11:16,748 --> 00:11:19,586
beware of low branches."

48
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,151
I heard it crying.

49
00:12:29,558 --> 00:12:31,353
She's starving.

50
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:34,958
Well, we have some
scraps inside. We could maybe...

51
00:12:35,094 --> 00:12:37,160
What happens
when those are gone?

52
00:12:38,828 --> 00:12:43,265
There's nothing more pure
than the instinct to survive.

53
00:12:44,968 --> 00:12:47,139
The wolf holds no pity.

54
00:12:47,909 --> 00:12:51,440
Just the desire
to live another day.

55
00:12:51,575 --> 00:12:55,508
What would you do to the wolf,
if you were starving?

56
00:12:58,717 --> 00:12:59,952
You're its prey.

57
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,823
We all are.

58
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,563
But what about the baby?

59
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,665
Will suffer and die alone.

60
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,429
Now, do what I say, Helena.

61
00:13:19,466 --> 00:13:21,138
- But if...
- Helena, move.

62
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:31,280
You must always
protect your family.

63
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,647
Nah.
This is one of my alone trips.

64
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,188
- But I can help.
- No, come on. You know the rules.

65
00:14:09,324 --> 00:14:11,589
I'll bring you back a surprise.
What kind of surprise?

66
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:15,621
Kind of surprise you're gonna have
to wait to find out what it is.

67
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:17,860
Now, get on back there.

68
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:19,229
I'll be home soon.

69
00:15:40,376 --> 00:15:43,379
Sorry to come ridin' in on you.

70
00:15:47,283 --> 00:15:48,648
Is your mom or dad around?

71
00:15:53,461 --> 00:15:54,719
Hey.

72
00:15:54,855 --> 00:15:57,022
Hope I'm not trespassing
or anything.

73
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:59,758
Didn't know
anybody lived way out here.

74
00:16:01,864 --> 00:16:04,498
Been out for hours,
and I got all spun around. I...

75
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:06,704
I can't find my way back
to the trail.

76
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,473
No signal out here anywhere.

77
00:16:12,774 --> 00:16:14,677
Look, if you could just
point me toward...

78
00:16:14,812 --> 00:16:16,078
Help!

79
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,183
Please. Before he gets back.

80
00:16:18,882 --> 00:16:20,119
What?

81
00:16:22,184 --> 00:16:23,382
What are we doing?

82
00:16:23,518 --> 00:16:25,056
What are... What are you doing?

83
00:16:25,325 --> 00:16:26,663
- Get on, Helena.
- Whoa. Hang on.

84
00:16:26,687 --> 00:16:28,224
- He'll be back soon.
- Who?

85
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,427
- Please, we have to go. Now!
- I...

86
00:16:30,562 --> 00:16:32,364
- I don't wanna go!
- I can't just take you.

87
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,420
I'm not even sure where we are.
That's why I'm...

88
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:42,702
No!

89
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:52,580
Mother! Mother, stop!

90
00:16:53,382 --> 00:16:55,814
Mother! Mother, stop! Stop!

91
00:16:57,155 --> 00:16:58,588
Helena!
No!

92
00:16:58,724 --> 00:16:59,724
Father!

93
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,497
Father!

94
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,197
Helena?

95
00:17:06,332 --> 00:17:07,826
- Father!
- Helena?

96
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,598
No!

97
00:17:13,201 --> 00:17:14,833
Stop! Stop!

98
00:17:27,721 --> 00:17:29,221
Somebody!

99
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,521
Somebody!

100
00:18:32,953 --> 00:18:34,220
Look who's awake.

101
00:18:35,022 --> 00:18:36,453
It's okay, Helena.

102
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,621
Your mother's
just in the next room.

103
00:18:40,323 --> 00:18:41,488
Where's my father?

104
00:18:41,624 --> 00:18:45,131
He's not here. You're safe now.

105
00:18:45,266 --> 00:18:47,332
There's nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

106
00:18:49,465 --> 00:18:50,698
Don't worry about that.

107
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:05,680
Helena.

108
00:19:07,147 --> 00:19:10,017
We shouldn't be here.
I want to go home.

109
00:19:10,953 --> 00:19:13,655
- That wasn't our home.
- What did you do?

110
00:19:14,762 --> 00:19:17,629
What did you do?

111
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:20,629
I want Father.
- He can't be near us.

112
00:19:21,736 --> 00:19:22,895
Ever again.

113
00:19:24,906 --> 00:19:26,734
He took me, Helena.

114
00:19:27,906 --> 00:19:28,936
Jacob...

115
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,272
kidnapped me
and took me to the woods.

116
00:19:32,407 --> 00:19:33,740
You're lying.

117
00:19:34,009 --> 00:19:37,177
You're a liar.
You have always been a liar.

118
00:19:37,312 --> 00:19:38,713
Father told me.

119
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:42,582
Stop crying!

120
00:19:42,717 --> 00:19:44,521
You're not allowed to do that.

121
00:19:44,656 --> 00:19:46,622
We need to let your mother rest.

122
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,591
Just for a few minutes.

123
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:51,726
We'll be okay. Helena?

124
00:20:53,959 --> 00:20:55,361
Father?

125
00:21:11,876 --> 00:21:14,006
- Who's out?
- Yeah.

126
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:48,414
Okay, we have to go. Come on.

127
00:21:53,615 --> 00:21:55,520
You did good. Come on.

128
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,758
Okay, let's go this way.

129
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:02,754
- There he is!
- Police! Don't move!

130
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,324
Are we gonna go home?

131
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:05,593
One day we will.

132
00:22:05,728 --> 00:22:07,631
Hey! Don't move!

133
00:22:11,072 --> 00:22:12,271
Back away from the girl.

134
00:22:12,506 --> 00:22:14,572
No!
On your stomach!

135
00:22:14,908 --> 00:22:15,908
Now!

136
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:17,474
He didn't do anything wrong.

137
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:19,543
Let me see your hands.

138
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,374
I'll come find you,
Little Shadow.

139
00:22:22,509 --> 00:22:24,747
He's running! I got him!

140
00:22:24,882 --> 00:22:26,980
- Hands behind your back!
- Daddy!

141
00:23:31,845 --> 00:23:33,618
Shoot.

142
00:24:17,231 --> 00:24:18,993
No running, Marigold.

143
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:22,827
Hi, sweetie.

144
00:24:23,062 --> 00:24:26,968
Mrs. Haver said she has a life of
her own, and if you're gonna be late,

145
00:24:27,104 --> 00:24:29,641
she's gonna
start charging you rent for me.

146
00:24:29,776 --> 00:24:32,075
- She did, huh?
- What does that mean?

147
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:35,575
It means you are so valuable,
she thinks I should pay for you.

148
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,277
Whatcha got here?

149
00:24:37,479 --> 00:24:39,747
- My science project. It's a habitat.
- Uh-huh.

150
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:42,515
Habitat? Who's the habitat for?

151
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:44,451
A baby deer.

152
00:24:44,754 --> 00:24:49,258
It sleeps over here, beside the
rocks, to keep it safe from hunters.

153
00:24:49,393 --> 00:24:50,691
Smart deer.

154
00:24:52,628 --> 00:24:53,962
Mommy!

155
00:24:55,666 --> 00:24:57,130
What kind of leaf is this?

156
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,030
A walnut.

157
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,871
From which tree?
You tell me.

158
00:25:02,977 --> 00:25:03,977
There.

159
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,044
Mm-hmm.

160
00:25:05,072 --> 00:25:07,177
And what's that tree?

161
00:25:07,312 --> 00:25:08,512
A red oak.

162
00:25:08,647 --> 00:25:10,445
It doesn't look red to me.

163
00:25:10,581 --> 00:25:12,216
It will be in the fall.

164
00:25:12,352 --> 00:25:13,546
Do you see the bird?

165
00:25:15,486 --> 00:25:16,783
A wood thrush.

166
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:19,489
How do you know all the names?

167
00:25:19,624 --> 00:25:21,956
I can teach you if you want.

168
00:25:22,091 --> 00:25:24,161
I can see a bunny rabbit.

169
00:25:24,296 --> 00:25:25,929
Where?

170
00:25:26,065 --> 00:25:29,933
You have to kind of
tilt your head. See the ears?

171
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:32,938
Oh, yeah. I see it.
With the tail down this way?

172
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,101
Yeah.

173
00:25:37,511 --> 00:25:40,074
It means that we're one.

174
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:43,616
Family.

175
00:25:44,217 --> 00:25:45,816
Mom?

176
00:25:47,015 --> 00:25:49,214
When can I have one of these?

177
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,049
Not until you're 82 years old.

178
00:25:51,184 --> 00:25:52,850
That's the rule, remember?

179
00:25:52,985 --> 00:25:54,218
That's not fair.

180
00:25:54,354 --> 00:25:56,421
You got them
when you were young.

181
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,830
I was much older than you,
and I wish I hadn't.

182
00:26:00,563 --> 00:26:02,133
I like them.

183
00:26:02,268 --> 00:26:03,268
I like you.

184
00:26:17,484 --> 00:26:19,113
Daddy's home!

185
00:26:21,114 --> 00:26:23,119
Put your stuff inside, sweetie.

186
00:26:23,255 --> 00:26:25,218
We're going to the campus
for Daddy's work picnic.

187
00:26:25,353 --> 00:26:26,789
Picnic?
Sorry we're late.

188
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:28,264
I forgot about
your thing tonight.

189
00:26:28,288 --> 00:26:30,427
That's all right. Let's just go.

190
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,270
I have to change. Why don't you go on
over with her, and I'll come later.

191
00:26:33,294 --> 00:26:35,098
Well, we've tried that.
You never show.

192
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:37,502
I'm just not good at those things.
Neither am I.

193
00:26:37,637 --> 00:26:39,334
Which is why you're coming with.

194
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:42,004
Plus, you're my beautiful wife,
and I want to show you off.

195
00:26:49,245 --> 00:26:50,681
You know, it's funny.

196
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:52,681
Thank you.

197
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:54,615
Hey, you good?
Yeah.

198
00:26:54,751 --> 00:26:56,317
Is Marigold having fun?

199
00:26:56,452 --> 00:26:58,292
I don't know.
The crazy thing is,

200
00:26:58,322 --> 00:26:59,968
my students don't even try
to hide it anymore.

201
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,619
Phones are going off
my entire lecture.

202
00:27:01,855 --> 00:27:04,657
Well, in their defense, I have
heard some of your lectures.

203
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:10,596
I love that. It's unusual.

204
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:13,871
Oh, thanks.
- Did you get it around here?

205
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:16,401
Uh, in San Francisco,
when I was a teenager.

206
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:19,446
You have a bunch of them.

207
00:27:19,578 --> 00:27:21,077
Too many.

208
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:23,479
I didn't know
you're from San Francisco.

209
00:27:23,615 --> 00:27:26,746
Other places too. We moved around a lot.
What'd your parents do?

210
00:27:26,882 --> 00:27:29,986
My father worked in insurance,
my mom sometimes did telemarketing.

211
00:27:30,121 --> 00:27:32,824
Doesn't get much more boring
than that.

212
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,028
"Then she took 20
mattresses and laid them on the pea.

213
00:27:39,164 --> 00:27:42,460
On this, the princess
had to lie all night.

214
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:45,600
In the morning
she was asked how she had slept.

215
00:27:45,736 --> 00:27:47,300
And the princess said...

216
00:27:52,439 --> 00:27:54,747
'Oh, very badly.'"

217
00:30:29,465 --> 00:30:31,833
What's going on?
Where's my daughter?

218
00:30:31,969 --> 00:30:32,969
Helena Erikkson?

219
00:30:33,035 --> 00:30:34,567
Where's Marigold?

220
00:30:34,736 --> 00:30:36,280
She's not here.
This isn't about her.

221
00:30:36,304 --> 00:30:38,170
I'm Special Agent Illing.

222
00:30:38,305 --> 00:30:40,175
What are you doing in my house?

223
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,781
Ms. Erikkson.
My name is Pelletier.

224
00:30:42,917 --> 00:30:45,381
Before that,
it was Jones, correct?

225
00:30:45,517 --> 00:30:48,012
Then Mitchell, after you
changed it from Bekkum.

226
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:52,056
But you were born to Jacob
Holbrook and Beth Erikkson.

227
00:30:52,757 --> 00:30:54,087
What do you want?

228
00:30:54,222 --> 00:30:56,862
Your father, Jacob Holbrook.

229
00:30:56,998 --> 00:30:58,759
He and another prisoner
escaped last night

230
00:30:59,028 --> 00:31:02,433
while being transported across the
state line to Alger Penitentiary.

231
00:31:03,136 --> 00:31:05,069
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

232
00:31:05,904 --> 00:31:07,633
When I was ten years old.

233
00:31:07,768 --> 00:31:10,103
- Has he tried to contact you recently?
- No.

234
00:31:10,238 --> 00:31:11,836
Are you sure? Not even once?

235
00:31:12,038 --> 00:31:14,446
You could've called me.
You didn't need to come here.

236
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:15,640
What's going on?

237
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:18,412
You okay?

238
00:31:18,547 --> 00:31:20,414
Do you know where your father
might be going?

239
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:22,283
Y-Your father?

240
00:31:22,452 --> 00:31:24,422
You can't just
come into my house.

241
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,900
Our warrant allows us to
check for any possible communication

242
00:31:26,924 --> 00:31:28,423
to or from your father.

243
00:31:28,592 --> 00:31:30,527
Why do you keep saying that?
Helena's father...

244
00:31:30,695 --> 00:31:32,435
He doesn't know where I live,
doesn't know my last name,

245
00:31:32,459 --> 00:31:34,532
doesn't know anything about me.

246
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,808
And that's same for your
family and friends? Have any of your...

247
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:39,532
I've never told anyone
Jacob Holbrook is my father.

248
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,139
So, 20 years.

249
00:31:44,274 --> 00:31:47,839
No letter,
birthday card, anything?

250
00:31:47,975 --> 00:31:48,975
No.

251
00:31:49,044 --> 00:31:50,377
I'm confused.

252
00:31:50,646 --> 00:31:52,292
I thought your parents died
in a car accident.

253
00:31:52,316 --> 00:31:54,345
That's what I told you.

254
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,029
And Holbrook, that's the Marsh King guy.
The one that just escaped.

255
00:31:57,053 --> 00:31:58,755
I heard it on the radio.

256
00:31:58,891 --> 00:32:01,190
That's right.

257
00:32:01,326 --> 00:32:03,061
Is there any risk
of him coming here?

258
00:32:03,196 --> 00:32:04,434
That's what we're trying
to find out.

259
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:06,327
He doesn't know where I live.

260
00:32:06,463 --> 00:32:08,726
Oh,
you can't be too sure of that.

261
00:32:08,861 --> 00:32:11,269
Christ, Helena.
How could you not have told me?

262
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,666
I told you to stay in the car, sweetie.

263
00:32:13,801 --> 00:32:16,636
- Who are these people?
- Police. They're just...

264
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:18,571
I'm gonna take her.
I'll call you later.

265
00:32:21,243 --> 00:32:24,544
We're gonna need to see
your phone and any computers you use.

266
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:27,118
With any luck,
your father will be found soon.

267
00:32:28,053 --> 00:32:29,683
You don't know my father.

268
00:32:29,886 --> 00:32:33,786
If he makes it to the wild,
you'll never see him again.

269
00:32:33,955 --> 00:32:36,255
<i>In a case that received
nationwide notoriety,</i>

270
00:32:36,424 --> 00:32:39,929
<i>Jacob Holbrook, the so-called
"Marsh King," abducted Beth Erikkson</i>

271
00:32:40,098 --> 00:32:41,829
<i>and held her for 12 years</i>

272
00:32:41,964 --> 00:32:43,374
<i>in the wilderness
of Michigan's Upper Peninsula,</i>

273
00:32:43,398 --> 00:32:45,162
<i>until she eventually escaped</i>

274
00:32:45,498 --> 00:32:47,803
<i>with the daughter she gave
birth to while in captivity.</i>

275
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:50,776
<i>After the trial, Erikkson had
difficulty adapting to normal life</i>

276
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:52,742
<i>and was rarely seen in public.</i>

277
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:55,707
<i>Tragically, she died four years
ago in an apparent suicide.</i>

278
00:33:21,433 --> 00:33:23,037
<i>Yeah?</i>

279
00:33:23,172 --> 00:33:25,272
You guys coming home?

280
00:33:25,407 --> 00:33:28,514
<i>I grabbed a hotel room
for the night. Mari's in the pool.</i>

281
00:33:28,649 --> 00:33:32,617
I could bring her over
some school clothes, if you want.

282
00:33:32,752 --> 00:33:35,615
<i>I'm keeping her
out tomorrow, just in case.</i>

283
00:33:36,883 --> 00:33:38,350
I didn't think
this would happen.

284
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:39,790
<i>That I'd find out?</i>

285
00:33:39,925 --> 00:33:42,194
No. I mean, I wish I...

286
00:33:42,329 --> 00:33:43,825
<i>Mari's yelling for me.
I gotta go.</i>

287
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:13,147
<i>Little Shadow.</i>

288
00:35:13,283 --> 00:35:14,950
Time to check our snares.

289
00:35:15,086 --> 00:35:16,815
And a real hunter...

290
00:35:18,892 --> 00:35:21,160
needs a real knife.

291
00:35:24,325 --> 00:35:25,824
This is yours now.

292
00:35:27,496 --> 00:35:29,597
Let's see how you do with it.

293
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:25,003
Hi.

294
00:38:26,305 --> 00:38:28,941
I called earlier,
but you didn't answer.

295
00:38:29,711 --> 00:38:31,614
I'm not great with phones.

296
00:38:32,582 --> 00:38:33,946
That's an understatement.

297
00:38:35,350 --> 00:38:36,551
I saw the news.

298
00:38:36,853 --> 00:38:39,358
Thought I'd shoot down
and say hello.

299
00:38:40,224 --> 00:38:41,591
Hello, Clark.

300
00:38:41,859 --> 00:38:45,089
Maybe grab a glass of water
before I head back.

301
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:01,810
I know you
don't want me dropping in,

302
00:39:01,945 --> 00:39:04,515
but I figured
everything's changed a bit now.

303
00:39:05,383 --> 00:39:07,284
Cat's outta the bag.

304
00:39:07,419 --> 00:39:08,952
How's your husband taking it?

305
00:39:09,087 --> 00:39:10,455
Not well.

306
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:13,051
He'll come around.
Just a matter of time.

307
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:16,692
The little one's
not so little anymore.

308
00:39:17,961 --> 00:39:20,424
Your mother
would've loved to have met her.

309
00:39:21,494 --> 00:39:24,695
I thought you might bring
Marigold up home a while back,

310
00:39:24,831 --> 00:39:26,933
at least for the funeral.

311
00:39:27,068 --> 00:39:29,067
She wouldn't have
met her then either.

312
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:31,874
That's true enough.

313
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:34,545
Then, I guess I meant
I wish you woulda come sooner.

314
00:39:35,413 --> 00:39:36,778
She would've liked that.

315
00:39:41,818 --> 00:39:43,653
He still has that job
at the college?

316
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:47,558
You still doing...
Nothing's changed.

317
00:39:48,061 --> 00:39:50,090
Okay.

318
00:39:50,993 --> 00:39:53,325
This is not how I saw this
playing out.

319
00:39:54,328 --> 00:39:57,931
I'm sorry,
I just can't do this right now.

320
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,007
Well,
at least it's not in the press.

321
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:11,575
No one's putting you with him.

322
00:40:11,711 --> 00:40:14,552
Just wanted to make sure you
weren't worried about things.

323
00:40:15,153 --> 00:40:16,752
I'm not.

324
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:22,621
You know, there was a space
when you were about 13 or so.

325
00:40:22,756 --> 00:40:27,125
I thought we had a shot at bei" a
nice little family, the three of us.

326
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,634
It was never the three of us, Clark.

327
00:40:31,437 --> 00:40:33,230
She didn't want me around.

328
00:40:33,365 --> 00:40:35,771
When she looked at me,
she saw my father.

329
00:40:36,372 --> 00:40:37,608
So did you.

330
00:40:38,076 --> 00:40:39,509
No.

331
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:41,480
You're forgetting
some good days.

332
00:40:42,511 --> 00:40:43,911
She loved you.

333
00:40:44,876 --> 00:40:46,144
I still love you.

334
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:48,916
I miss you.

335
00:40:51,089 --> 00:40:54,158
But sure, maybe sometimes
we saw a little Jacob in you.

336
00:40:55,893 --> 00:40:58,189
Or maybe you never saw
enough of him in me.

337
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,336
- You here to relieve this fella?
- No, I'm supposed to...

338
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:12,341
Mrs. Pelletier, the FBI would like
you to come down to the office.

339
00:41:12,476 --> 00:41:13,671
Did something come up?

340
00:41:13,807 --> 00:41:15,173
Way above my pay grade.

341
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:17,978
You want me to come with you?

342
00:41:19,584 --> 00:41:21,619
We found your father's body.

343
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,756
Just inside the state line.

344
00:41:24,892 --> 00:41:27,551
We assume they were heading
for a crossing to Canada.

345
00:41:27,687 --> 00:41:30,220
Guard rail, 60 feet up on the
embankment was splintered.

346
00:41:30,356 --> 00:41:32,793
Driver either lost control
or fell asleep.

347
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,127
The car hit a tree
and caught fire.

348
00:41:35,262 --> 00:41:37,935
Both men were burned
beyond recognition.

349
00:41:38,071 --> 00:41:41,067
We think they had an accomplice.
We're looking for him now.

350
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,103
How can you be sure
it's Holbrook?

351
00:41:47,806 --> 00:41:52,111
He has three gold teeth with
carvings matching your father.

352
00:41:58,521 --> 00:41:59,756
You all right?

353
00:42:02,791 --> 00:42:04,695
My father died 20 years ago.

354
00:42:38,462 --> 00:42:40,060
Mmm.

355
00:42:41,193 --> 00:42:43,397
I'm sorry about your daddy.

356
00:42:43,532 --> 00:42:45,564
We saw it on TV.

357
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:49,137
Thank you, sweetie, but he
wasn't my daddy for a long time.

358
00:42:49,273 --> 00:42:52,303
We brought you some food
in case you didn't wanna cook.

359
00:42:53,073 --> 00:42:55,605
Let me guess, extra pepperoni?

360
00:42:55,741 --> 00:42:58,980
- I'm definitely in the mood for pizza.
- Yes!

361
00:43:02,552 --> 00:43:03,952
How you doing?

362
00:43:04,521 --> 00:43:05,756
I'm fine.

363
00:43:09,391 --> 00:43:12,125
I wish you would've told me
the truth.

364
00:43:13,558 --> 00:43:15,733
What's the worst
that could've happened?

365
00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,935
- We wouldn't have Mari.
- You don't know that.

366
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:22,403
Yes, I do.

367
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:26,036
Who in their right mind would
get involved with the daughter...

368
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:30,679
If you knew my name was Holbrook, you'd
never have gone on a date with me.

369
00:43:30,814 --> 00:43:32,509
You would've run the other way.

370
00:43:33,245 --> 00:43:35,450
- You will now.
- Hold on.

371
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:39,989
Let's pretend that I'm a better
person than you think I am, all right?

372
00:43:40,125 --> 00:43:42,157
What's the best thing
that could've happened?

373
00:43:43,027 --> 00:43:45,423
You might've found
somebody to trust.

374
00:43:45,558 --> 00:43:49,999
Someone to help you through
all the shitty days.

375
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:52,902
Somebody to explain
all your weird tattoos to.

376
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,141
The best never happens, Stephen.

377
00:44:01,877 --> 00:44:03,715
No matter how badly we want it.

378
00:44:25,901 --> 00:44:27,799
Marigold okay?
Yeah.

379
00:44:27,934 --> 00:44:29,169
She's asleep.

380
00:44:30,642 --> 00:44:32,073
Do you really believe that?

381
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,242
What you said before about...

382
00:44:38,045 --> 00:44:39,610
the best never happening.

383
00:44:40,913 --> 00:44:44,151
Because if
you do, what's that mean for us?

384
00:44:46,786 --> 00:44:51,396
Look I... I don't wanna make
this any worse for you.

385
00:44:51,531 --> 00:44:54,062
But you gotta let me in, Helena.

386
00:44:59,635 --> 00:45:02,873
Okay, look. I'm gonna go
do some work at the office.

387
00:45:04,874 --> 00:45:06,371
Probably sleep over there.

388
00:45:52,152 --> 00:45:53,990
My name is Helena Holbrook.

389
00:45:56,259 --> 00:45:58,555
Remember the guy
who kidnapped that woman?

390
00:45:59,492 --> 00:46:02,130
The one everybody called
The Marsh King?

391
00:46:03,932 --> 00:46:05,166
I'm his daughter.

392
00:46:11,508 --> 00:46:16,278
Sometimes I sneak off alone
at night because I feel trapped.

393
00:46:16,413 --> 00:46:20,577
Like I can't figure out
which world I really belong in.

394
00:46:26,421 --> 00:46:29,390
I have trouble trusting people because...

395
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:34,459
everyone tells me the person
I believed in the most

396
00:46:35,161 --> 00:46:36,868
was really a monster.

397
00:46:41,908 --> 00:46:44,403
He gave me this
after my first kill.

398
00:46:54,951 --> 00:46:56,580
And this one when I missed.

399
00:46:59,586 --> 00:47:01,959
This is the place
he taught me to swim.

400
00:47:09,635 --> 00:47:10,968
The name he gave me.

401
00:47:13,402 --> 00:47:16,435
This to remind me never to wait
to do my chores.

402
00:47:21,512 --> 00:47:25,015
These were the only tears
my father ever wanted to see.

403
00:47:30,089 --> 00:47:32,484
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

404
00:48:01,649 --> 00:48:04,186
- Come on. I know.
- I can do it.

405
00:48:04,321 --> 00:48:06,488
I have been looking forward
to this day.

406
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:09,058
Thought it was time to introduce
you to a couple people.

407
00:48:09,194 --> 00:48:11,055
Look, Daddy, they have horses.

408
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:14,828
This is Clark. He's gonna try his
best to get you to call him Grandpa.

409
00:48:14,963 --> 00:48:16,426
Make him earn it.

410
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,595
That doesn't scare me a bit.

411
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:20,399
I've got no one else
to spend it on.

412
00:48:20,535 --> 00:48:23,000
It is very nice to meet you, Marigold.

413
00:48:23,135 --> 00:48:24,540
You too, Clark.

414
00:48:26,108 --> 00:48:27,339
I'm gonna like this one.

415
00:48:27,475 --> 00:48:29,706
Would you like
to see the horses?

416
00:49:29,909 --> 00:49:31,471
Who's getting hungry?

417
00:49:41,414 --> 00:49:43,317
Two hours after I took that,

418
00:49:43,453 --> 00:49:45,849
I started getting calls
that some hoodlum

419
00:49:45,984 --> 00:49:48,590
was setting off fireworks
in people's yards.

420
00:49:48,725 --> 00:49:52,024
She tore that dress to shreds,
running from one of my deputies.

421
00:49:52,159 --> 00:49:53,893
You can stop now.

422
00:49:54,028 --> 00:49:56,271
Oh, hell, we haven't even got
to your difficult stage yet.

423
00:49:56,295 --> 00:49:58,102
Who's that?

424
00:50:00,335 --> 00:50:02,304
That's your grandmother.

425
00:50:04,108 --> 00:50:05,703
You definitely take after her.

426
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:09,912
I don't remember that picture.

427
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,083
It looks like us.

428
00:50:16,984 --> 00:50:20,289
You know, I wouldn't complain
if this became a habit.

429
00:50:28,129 --> 00:50:29,364
Thank you, Clark.

430
00:50:29,964 --> 00:50:31,201
Anytime.

431
00:50:31,966 --> 00:50:33,501
Hey.

432
00:50:33,704 --> 00:50:36,766
You know, Jacob took a lot
of my people's beliefs,

433
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:40,441
twisted 'em
to fit what suited him.

434
00:50:43,545 --> 00:50:46,744
Means "owned" in Ojibwa.
Not "family."

435
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:48,779
Don't confuse the two.

436
00:51:19,412 --> 00:51:21,779
Sh...

437
00:51:54,546 --> 00:51:56,253
Little Shadow.

438
00:52:11,366 --> 00:52:12,632
What's wrong?

439
00:52:17,274 --> 00:52:19,705
I'm just getting some water.

440
00:54:28,041 --> 00:54:32,104
Hey, make sure you wipe your
feet when you come in the house.

441
00:54:32,239 --> 00:54:33,509
I did.

442
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:35,841
I'll drop her on the way.

443
00:54:36,344 --> 00:54:37,877
See you after.

444
00:54:38,113 --> 00:54:39,924
We'll go swimming or something.
Don't forget my goggles.

445
00:54:39,948 --> 00:54:42,314
I got that conference
in Detroit this afternoon.

446
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:43,684
Might be home late.

447
00:54:44,817 --> 00:54:46,049
You gonna be okay?
Mmm.

448
00:54:57,529 --> 00:54:58,765
Thank you.

449
00:55:04,106 --> 00:55:05,204
Helena?

450
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:06,740
How you doing?

451
00:55:07,407 --> 00:55:09,213
Good. Fine.

452
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:10,943
Are you guys
around this weekend?

453
00:55:11,079 --> 00:55:13,477
I was thinking Jess and Marigold
could have a playdate.

454
00:55:13,612 --> 00:55:17,619
Oh, yeah. I think we're free, just...

455
00:55:21,788 --> 00:55:24,191
Sorry. Yeah, she'd love that.

456
00:55:24,326 --> 00:55:26,828
How's Saturday? Would she like
to come over to our place?

457
00:55:26,964 --> 00:55:30,265
Of course. She has swim
until 10:00 but after that...

458
00:55:42,445 --> 00:55:44,877
Can you hold on a second? Sorry.

459
00:57:02,657 --> 00:57:04,520
You're not helping.

460
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:08,526
I'm not supposed to help.
This is your homework, not mine.

461
00:57:08,662 --> 00:57:09,892
But you always help.

462
00:57:10,028 --> 00:57:12,136
Well, you can figure this out.

463
00:57:12,271 --> 00:57:15,231
Why are you in a bad mood again?

464
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,936
I'm not.

465
00:57:18,211 --> 00:57:19,405
I don't mean to be.

466
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:23,673
Let's go read. We'll get Daddy
to help us finish in the morning.

467
00:57:23,809 --> 00:57:25,747
Okay?
Okay.

468
00:57:29,515 --> 00:57:32,521
"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool

469
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,252
like a carpet patterned
with flowers.

470
00:57:35,387 --> 00:57:38,656
And on this carpet,
lay a young and beautiful woman.

471
00:57:38,792 --> 00:57:44,431
The mother cried, 'Is this myself
I see, reflected in your eyes?'

472
00:57:44,567 --> 00:57:46,097
And the daughter said..."

473
00:57:48,938 --> 00:57:51,740
Hey, daughter?
You missed your entrance.

474
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,305
<i>Helena.</i>

475
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:43,925
What is it?
It's a doll.

476
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:47,598
You... You play with it.

477
00:58:48,431 --> 00:58:49,666
Like a friend.

478
00:58:56,308 --> 00:58:57,308
She has hair like me.

479
00:58:58,639 --> 00:59:00,006
A tiny Helena.

480
01:00:24,591 --> 01:00:25,993
Oh, God.

481
01:00:28,299 --> 01:00:29,392
Marigold!

482
01:00:34,238 --> 01:00:35,238
Helena!

483
01:00:35,373 --> 01:00:36,499
Hey, it's me.

484
01:00:36,868 --> 01:00:37,868
It's me.

485
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:42,039
Jesus. What are you...

486
01:00:42,174 --> 01:00:45,145
Uh... I...
Whose blood is that?

487
01:00:45,281 --> 01:00:48,583
No one's. A rabbit.
I heard somebody outside.

488
01:00:48,718 --> 01:00:50,316
Maybe try calling the police

489
01:00:50,552 --> 01:00:53,082
instead of running around
in the dark with a knife.

490
01:00:53,218 --> 01:00:57,393
- I have to check on Marigold.
- Marigold's fine. She's asleep.

491
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:58,621
I just left her room.

492
01:00:59,257 --> 01:01:00,593
Did you see anyone out there?

493
01:01:03,564 --> 01:01:05,066
Hey.

494
01:01:05,302 --> 01:01:07,536
We're gonna keep the
doors locked, all right?

495
01:01:07,672 --> 01:01:09,300
Get a few cop cars on patrol.

496
01:01:11,609 --> 01:01:13,073
It's gonna be okay.

497
01:01:43,007 --> 01:01:45,206
<i>It was bleeding from the head.</i>

498
01:01:45,342 --> 01:01:48,911
Like someone killed it first,
then put it in the snare.

499
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,678
Or maybe it got injured
some other way.

500
01:01:52,813 --> 01:01:57,179
What's got you spooked? Why do
you think there's something more?

501
01:01:57,314 --> 01:01:59,757
I feel like he's here.

502
01:01:59,892 --> 01:02:02,658
<i>The night you found us,</i>

503
01:02:02,793 --> 01:02:04,355
<i>when we came out of the woods,</i>

504
01:02:04,491 --> 01:02:07,226
I was so afraid
because he wasn't there with me.

505
01:02:08,928 --> 01:02:10,094
But then he came.

506
01:02:10,229 --> 01:02:11,931
Don't get lost in this, Helena.

507
01:02:12,066 --> 01:02:13,903
<i>Now he's come back again.</i>

508
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:16,533
<i>I have to tell him
to leave us alone.</i>

509
01:02:16,668 --> 01:02:19,770
You have got to try to get him
out of your head.

510
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:21,072
For good.

511
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,512
I'm not sure I can do that.

512
01:02:23,647 --> 01:02:25,311
How could he be alive?

513
01:02:25,813 --> 01:02:27,147
I don't know.

514
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:36,886
<i>There's nothing purer
than the instinct to survive.</i>

515
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:02,017
Mommy!

516
01:03:06,787 --> 01:03:08,023
Marigold?

517
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,557
I couldn't find my backpack.

518
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,560
Oh, no, no, no. That stays here.

519
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,232
I wanna show people.

520
01:03:20,368 --> 01:03:22,436
Let's wait a while on that, okay?

521
01:03:22,571 --> 01:03:23,973
Okay.

522
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:35,147
Where did you get those?

523
01:03:35,283 --> 01:03:38,015
I thought you made them.
I like them.

524
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,088
Looks like you and me.

525
01:03:50,895 --> 01:03:53,904
Has the habitat been in
your room the whole time?

526
01:03:54,801 --> 01:03:56,104
Mm-hmm.

527
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:15,024
What are you doing?

528
01:04:24,666 --> 01:04:25,936
Come on.

529
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,301
<i>Stay inside
after school unless Daddy</i>

530
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:37,112
<i>or I are here, okay? Don't go with
anyone else, no matter what they say.</i>

531
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:04,034
What's this about?

532
01:05:04,169 --> 01:05:05,469
Just felt like it.

533
01:05:05,704 --> 01:05:08,303
<i>Can you pick Marigold up
after school?</i>

534
01:05:08,439 --> 01:05:10,673
<i>Of course.</i>

535
01:05:11,417 --> 01:05:12,417
<i>Why?</i>

536
01:05:13,882 --> 01:05:17,152
<i>I have to do something.
I can't tell you what it is.</i>

537
01:05:23,392 --> 01:05:25,226
<i>What's going on, Helena?</i>

538
01:05:26,696 --> 01:05:30,363
<i>I know I haven't
given you any reason to...</i>

539
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,432
<i>please trust me.</i>

540
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:36,303
<i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>

541
01:05:37,205 --> 01:05:38,635
<i>Back from where?</i>

542
01:05:40,208 --> 01:05:41,638
<i>Last secret, Stephen.</i>

543
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:44,080
<i>Promise.</i>

544
01:06:04,329 --> 01:06:06,531
You and Mari rescued me.

545
01:08:10,956 --> 01:08:12,855
<i>I can call it anything I want?</i>

546
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,759
It's yours.
I gave it to you.

547
01:08:19,836 --> 01:08:21,171
I name it

548
01:08:22,004 --> 01:08:23,569
Helena Falls.

549
01:10:29,365 --> 01:10:31,301
Hello, Little Shadow.

550
01:11:15,773 --> 01:11:17,677
Let's go for a walk.

551
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,495
How did you find me?

552
01:11:37,630 --> 01:11:39,699
I never lost you, Little Shadow.

553
01:11:51,477 --> 01:11:53,350
I miss that smell.

554
01:11:56,482 --> 01:11:57,915
And the taste.

555
01:12:01,651 --> 01:12:02,887
Gimme that.

556
01:12:15,303 --> 01:12:16,835
My favorite knife.

557
01:12:39,091 --> 01:12:41,563
We used to come camping up here,
you remember?

558
01:12:42,533 --> 01:12:45,330
We'd lay out here
all summer long.

559
01:12:45,466 --> 01:12:46,765
Look up at the sky,

560
01:12:46,967 --> 01:12:48,687
see who could count
the most shooting stars.

561
01:12:49,573 --> 01:12:51,573
I used to cheat
and count airplanes.

562
01:12:55,242 --> 01:12:58,946
You knew I was alive the
whole time, didn't you?

563
01:12:59,749 --> 01:13:01,682
I didn't know
how it was possible.

564
01:13:02,652 --> 01:13:05,081
Not until I saw
a three-legged coyote.

565
01:13:06,689 --> 01:13:08,817
Sacrificed its own leg
for freedom.

566
01:13:08,952 --> 01:13:11,320
Like you sacrificed your teeth.

567
01:13:11,456 --> 01:13:13,495
Ah.

568
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:15,728
Probably won't pass
a medical exam,

569
01:13:15,864 --> 01:13:18,028
but it bought you
the time you needed.

570
01:13:19,665 --> 01:13:21,438
You did some digging.

571
01:13:22,105 --> 01:13:23,704
Well done.

572
01:13:28,944 --> 01:13:31,481
You didn't tell anyone else
your theory?

573
01:13:33,445 --> 01:13:34,847
Did you?

574
01:13:40,050 --> 01:13:42,085
Wish you'd brought Marigold.

575
01:13:43,459 --> 01:13:45,190
Tell me about my granddaughter.

576
01:13:45,326 --> 01:13:49,191
I don't think so. You know
enough about her already.

577
01:13:52,765 --> 01:13:54,603
Well, I had to take a peek.

578
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:58,805
You never brought her
to visit me.

579
01:14:00,609 --> 01:14:02,237
You didn't visit me at all.

580
01:14:06,679 --> 01:14:07,909
Come on, Little Shadow.

581
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:09,816
I want to show you something.

582
01:14:12,523 --> 01:14:15,822
You know,
Marigold looks like her.

583
01:14:16,423 --> 01:14:17,423
Your mother.

584
01:14:18,290 --> 01:14:20,794
I bet she loves the water
as much as we do.

585
01:14:25,703 --> 01:14:27,735
That's to take us
across the border.

586
01:14:28,369 --> 01:14:29,704
The three of us.

587
01:14:30,707 --> 01:14:32,806
To Canada,
we can be a family again.

588
01:14:33,671 --> 01:14:34,703
I have a family.

589
01:14:34,839 --> 01:14:36,209
You have a daughter.

590
01:14:36,345 --> 01:14:37,647
And a husband.

591
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:39,714
We've built a life together.

592
01:14:40,748 --> 01:14:42,211
Are you happy with that life?

593
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:45,817
Not always.

594
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,054
Do you ever think
back to what it was like

595
01:14:48,523 --> 01:14:49,622
when we lived here?

596
01:14:49,891 --> 01:14:53,530
- I do.
- We can have it all again.

597
01:14:56,129 --> 01:14:59,101
I remember
when you were four years old,

598
01:14:59,237 --> 01:15:01,067
you could shut your eyes

599
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:06,374
and you knew where you were
from the sound of the water,

600
01:15:06,509 --> 01:15:09,370
from the smell of the trees,

601
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:14,083
and the feel of the ground
beneath your feet.

602
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:15,915
It was like magic.

603
01:15:19,323 --> 01:15:21,090
This is where we belong.

604
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,054
It's our home.

605
01:15:23,557 --> 01:15:25,023
Our life here

606
01:15:26,097 --> 01:15:27,223
was perfect.

607
01:15:40,375 --> 01:15:41,476
No!

608
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:47,782
No!

609
01:15:52,021 --> 01:15:54,383
Don't you ever run away
from me again!

610
01:15:54,885 --> 01:15:56,692
Okay? You hear me?

611
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,258
I wasn't...

612
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:11,168
Perfect?

613
01:16:12,837 --> 01:16:14,073
Not for my mother.

614
01:16:14,643 --> 01:16:16,175
Well, it could've been.

615
01:16:16,311 --> 01:16:17,408
How?

616
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:21,743
- You kidnapped her.
- No. We ran away together.

617
01:16:21,878 --> 01:16:25,282
That's just something she said
when she decided to leave.

618
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:28,049
- You shot that man.
- I was trying to hit the engine.

619
01:16:28,184 --> 01:16:29,659
You never would have missed.

620
01:16:30,722 --> 01:16:32,356
I missed.

621
01:16:32,492 --> 01:16:35,727
You've been told a
bunch of stories about me.

622
01:16:35,862 --> 01:16:40,065
They're not true. I never was the
Marsh King, until they said I was.

623
01:16:42,671 --> 01:16:44,674
I know this, we were happy.

624
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:46,874
You were happy.

625
01:16:48,441 --> 01:16:51,345
All I'm saying, bring Marigold,
let her see for herself.

626
01:16:51,480 --> 01:16:52,946
I can't do that.

627
01:16:54,152 --> 01:16:55,311
I won't.

628
01:16:56,886 --> 01:16:58,721
I'm sorry.
This is where it ends.

629
01:17:00,855 --> 01:17:02,923
I shouldn't have come here.

630
01:17:05,923 --> 01:17:07,796
I'm glad I did.

631
01:17:11,868 --> 01:17:14,696
Now I have to go home
to my family.

632
01:17:15,432 --> 01:17:18,404
Please don't come
near them again.

633
01:17:19,274 --> 01:17:22,041
- It doesn't need to be like this.
- It does.

634
01:17:26,843 --> 01:17:28,245
Okay.

635
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:29,844
Okay.

636
01:17:29,980 --> 01:17:31,853
I understand.

637
01:17:39,929 --> 01:17:41,863
You'll always be
my Little Shadow.

638
01:17:45,798 --> 01:17:47,297
I have to go.

639
01:18:24,241 --> 01:18:25,269
Clark?

640
01:18:26,606 --> 01:18:29,843
- What are you doing here?
- Could ask you the same thing.

641
01:18:29,978 --> 01:18:32,210
Stephen called me.
He was worried.

642
01:18:32,345 --> 01:18:35,280
And I just had a hunch
after what you said.

643
01:18:36,717 --> 01:18:40,047
- Is he here?
- Let's go back. I'll tell you on the way.

644
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:43,089
Helena, was he here?

645
01:18:44,759 --> 01:18:45,993
But he's gone.

646
01:19:00,972 --> 01:19:02,711
Clark. Clark.

647
01:19:02,847 --> 01:19:05,848
Clark. Oh, God. Oh, God.

648
01:19:08,717 --> 01:19:10,519
Clark, look at me, okay?

649
01:19:10,654 --> 01:19:12,386
Clark. Clark, stay with me.

650
01:19:12,721 --> 01:19:15,784
You told him you were coming here?
No, I didn't say anything.

651
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:17,559
Please, look at me.

652
01:19:17,694 --> 01:19:19,554
Clark, I'm right here.

653
01:19:21,096 --> 01:19:23,126
Clark, hold on.
Please, Clark, hold on.

654
01:19:23,261 --> 01:19:25,127
You must've said something.

655
01:19:25,263 --> 01:19:27,134
Make your stepfather curious.

656
01:19:27,269 --> 01:19:30,202
Enough to wander out here
all this way by himself.

657
01:19:30,337 --> 01:19:32,974
Just get away from us.
What have you done?

658
01:19:34,876 --> 01:19:37,011
Please, Clark. Please. Come on.

659
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:38,881
Come on. Please.

660
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:41,178
Well, there's nothing you can do
to help him now.

661
01:19:46,521 --> 01:19:47,856
No!

662
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:50,222
You'd rather the wolf lived
than us?

663
01:19:52,292 --> 01:19:54,623
You want it to feed you
to its pup?

664
01:19:55,559 --> 01:19:57,928
Now I have to get Marigold
on my own.

665
01:19:58,064 --> 01:20:00,500
No! Don't you touch her!

666
01:20:10,143 --> 01:20:13,015
We can still all be a family.

667
01:20:13,517 --> 01:20:14,543
It's all I want.

668
01:20:15,478 --> 01:20:17,385
I'll be back with Marigold soon.

669
01:20:17,520 --> 01:20:19,251
No! No, no.

670
01:20:21,325 --> 01:20:22,353
No!

671
01:20:23,393 --> 01:20:24,421
No!

672
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:06,903
Helena.

673
01:21:17,044 --> 01:21:18,673
Wrap the rope around you.

674
01:21:20,949 --> 01:21:22,480
Did he say I could come up?

675
01:21:22,649 --> 01:21:24,947
I don't care,
I'm getting you out of there.

676
01:21:32,389 --> 01:21:34,458
I've got you, my Helena.

677
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,560
You're gonna be fine.

678
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:41,234
Because you're stronger than me.

679
01:21:42,737 --> 01:21:44,039
Braver than me.

680
01:23:25,641 --> 01:23:27,076
Please.

681
01:23:29,975 --> 01:23:31,377
Clark.

682
01:23:42,957 --> 01:23:44,687
I'm so sorry.

683
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,506
I'll come back for you.

684
01:25:05,174 --> 01:25:07,572
<i>All rivers bend, Helena.</i>

685
01:27:43,698 --> 01:27:45,929
<i>Is the blood warm or cold?</i>

686
01:27:46,832 --> 01:27:48,136
- Cold.
<i>- Cold.</i>

687
01:27:48,405 --> 01:27:50,900
<i>Then you must move faster.</i>

688
01:28:33,414 --> 01:28:35,384
<i>Running or walking?</i>

689
01:28:39,617 --> 01:28:41,390
<i>Running.</i>

690
01:28:43,359 --> 01:28:45,125
<i>And if you were afraid,</i>

691
01:28:45,261 --> 01:28:46,990
<i>running for your life,</i>

692
01:28:47,593 --> 01:28:49,123
<i>where would you run?</i>

693
01:28:54,132 --> 01:28:56,537
<i>To where no one could see me.</i>

694
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:11,948
You know what you taught me.

695
01:31:09,037 --> 01:31:11,837
You're fine,
it's just a flesh wound.

696
01:31:12,338 --> 01:31:13,338
Now...

697
01:31:14,037 --> 01:31:15,910
what good will it do Marigold

698
01:31:16,045 --> 01:31:20,076
if her mother is lying rotting
in the bottom of the marsh?

699
01:31:20,579 --> 01:31:22,111
She needs you.

700
01:31:23,446 --> 01:31:26,118
Just think about
what's best for your daughter.

701
01:31:26,253 --> 01:31:27,281
Okay?

702
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:29,756
No!

703
01:31:31,160 --> 01:31:32,660
No!

704
01:31:33,861 --> 01:31:37,258
The boat you came in. Show me.

705
01:32:22,276 --> 01:32:23,304
Go on.

706
01:32:25,276 --> 01:32:27,880
I waited my whole life
to see you again.

707
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:32,317
I wasn't sure what I would feel
when I did.

708
01:32:32,453 --> 01:32:35,089
- What do you feel, Little Shadow?
- Don't call me that.

709
01:32:35,224 --> 01:32:36,224
Not anymore.

710
01:32:37,489 --> 01:32:40,255
I used to think you said it
because I was always beside you.

711
01:32:41,696 --> 01:32:43,627
Now I realize you just meant,

712
01:32:43,762 --> 01:32:47,065
like any shadow, I wouldn't exist
if you weren't standing there.

713
01:32:47,200 --> 01:32:50,303
Your mother did a job on you
after I was gone.

714
01:32:50,438 --> 01:32:51,973
No, she didn't.

715
01:32:52,742 --> 01:32:54,602
I barely spoke
to her my whole life.

716
01:32:55,605 --> 01:32:58,476
I blamed her for everything too.
I never believed her.

717
01:32:58,611 --> 01:33:03,616
You really think she cared about
you the way I care about you?

718
01:33:03,752 --> 01:33:06,017
She wouldn't have a gun on me.

719
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:10,153
She could have run.

720
01:33:11,293 --> 01:33:12,727
Gotten away.

721
01:33:13,793 --> 01:33:15,697
She stayed to protect me.

722
01:33:17,030 --> 01:33:19,562
Now I know,
she was the strong one.

723
01:33:19,698 --> 01:33:21,331
She was weak.

724
01:33:21,467 --> 01:33:22,529
No.

725
01:33:23,665 --> 01:33:27,835
A man who drags a woman
into the wilderness is weak.

726
01:33:27,971 --> 01:33:30,943
Careful, Little Shadow.

727
01:33:32,916 --> 01:33:38,215
You forget all the things
that I did for you.

728
01:33:38,884 --> 01:33:41,951
The years I spent in a cage

729
01:33:42,086 --> 01:33:45,056
'cause I came back for you.

730
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:48,290
What would you do for Marigold?

731
01:34:01,542 --> 01:34:02,975
I'd die for her.

732
01:34:33,275 --> 01:34:34,604
Daddy!

733
01:34:40,812 --> 01:34:43,015
Come on. Come on.

734
01:35:27,759 --> 01:35:31,998
<i>"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool</i>

735
01:35:32,133 --> 01:35:34,663
<i>like a carpet patterned
with flowers.</i>

736
01:35:34,799 --> 01:35:39,638
<i>And on this carpet lay
a strong and beautiful woman.</i>

737
01:35:39,774 --> 01:35:46,414
The mother cried, 'Is this myself
I see, reflected in your eyes?'

738
01:35:46,550 --> 01:35:48,146
And the daughter said..."

739
01:35:48,879 --> 01:35:50,412
"Is it me I see,

740
01:35:51,752 --> 01:35:53,218
mirrored in yours?"

741
01:35:53,420 --> 01:35:56,887
"Then the child rose
in the shape of a mighty swan

742
01:35:57,022 --> 01:35:59,423
and spread her powerful wings."

743
01:36:58,148 --> 01:36:59,921
I don't hate you.

744
01:37:01,316 --> 01:37:02,887
I don't pity you.

745
01:37:03,022 --> 01:37:05,289
I just remember your lesson.

746
01:37:07,059 --> 01:37:08,890
Always protect my family.
