1
00:01:51,285 --> 00:01:53,069
<i>And the mother cried,</i>

2
00:01:53,243 --> 00:01:56,768
<i>"Is this myself I see,
reflected in your eyes?"</i>

3
00:01:57,595 --> 00:01:59,554
<i>And the daughter said,</i>

4
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:02,861
<i>"Is it me I see,
mirrored in yours?"</i>

5
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:04,619
Helena.

6
00:03:05,837 --> 00:03:07,404
Come back.

7
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,611
She's going to make you do twice
as many chores when you get back.

8
00:03:40,785 --> 00:03:43,397
I don't mind the trade.

9
00:03:43,571 --> 00:03:46,226
Maybe if we're gone long enough,
she'll forget she's mad.

10
00:03:47,966 --> 00:03:49,359
Okay.

11
00:03:50,665 --> 00:03:52,841
We'll walk slow, Little Shadow.

12
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,358
It was here.

13
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,273
Running or walking?

14
00:04:36,188 --> 00:04:39,496
The strides are wider
than before.

15
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,760
And deeper on the outsides.

16
00:04:48,462 --> 00:04:49,376
It was running.

17
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:50,855
Why?

18
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:54,946
Because it was scared
of something.

19
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,426
Scared of what?

20
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:00,604
Us.

21
00:05:02,606 --> 00:05:05,043
If you were afraid,

22
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:08,830
running for your life,
where would you go?

23
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:31,853
Where no one could see me.

24
00:06:10,108 --> 00:06:12,459
It's time you finished the hunt.

25
00:06:24,122 --> 00:06:25,210
What if I miss?

26
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,691
Then we go hungry tonight.

27
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:44,795
I didn't make a sound.

28
00:06:46,971 --> 00:06:48,930
So, what do you think happened?

29
00:06:58,156 --> 00:06:59,201
It smelled me.

30
00:07:07,383 --> 00:07:08,950
You won't need the fire.

31
00:07:19,047 --> 00:07:22,006
Helena,
come get what you earned today.

32
00:07:29,536 --> 00:07:31,929
She's always mad at me.

33
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:35,367
Oh, your mother
can't see happiness like we do.

34
00:08:46,177 --> 00:08:47,657
Okay.

35
00:08:47,831 --> 00:08:49,006
I'm fine.

36
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,095
It's getting late.

37
00:09:10,462 --> 00:09:12,726
Helena, no more.

38
00:09:57,509 --> 00:09:58,859
Where's the rest of it?

39
00:09:59,033 --> 00:10:00,295
It's free now.

40
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,995
It chewed its own leg off?

41
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:07,737
Sacrificed what it had to,
to survive.

42
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,226
When can I keep mine
in the house like you do?

43
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,881
When you're as good a hunter
as I am.

44
00:11:05,055 --> 00:11:06,274
Which will be never.

45
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:12,802
What do the marks say?

46
00:11:12,976 --> 00:11:14,238
They say,

47
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:16,240
"When you're running
from an angry moose,

48
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:19,809
beware of low branches."

49
00:12:27,137 --> 00:12:28,225
I heard it crying.

50
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:31,794
She's starving.

51
00:12:31,968 --> 00:12:35,276
Well, we have some
scraps inside. We could maybe..

52
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,234
What happens
when those are gone?

53
00:12:39,323 --> 00:12:43,371
There's nothing more pure
than the instinct to survive.

54
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:47,201
The wolf holds no pity.

55
00:12:48,202 --> 00:12:51,901
Just the desire
to live another day.

56
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:55,687
What would you do to the wolf,
if you were starving?

57
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,953
You're its prey.

58
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:02,782
We all are.

59
00:13:10,398 --> 00:13:11,747
But what about the baby?

60
00:13:11,921 --> 00:13:13,880
Will suffer and die alone.

61
00:13:14,054 --> 00:13:15,577
Now, do what I say, Helena.

62
00:13:19,929 --> 00:13:21,191
- But if..
- Helena, move.

63
00:13:29,243 --> 00:13:31,375
You must always
protect your family.

64
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:07,150
Nah.
This is one of my alone trips.

65
00:14:07,324 --> 00:14:09,457
- But I can help.
- No, come on. You know the rules.

66
00:14:09,631 --> 00:14:11,981
- I'll bring you back a surprise.
- What kind of surprise?

67
00:14:12,155 --> 00:14:15,811
Kind of surprise you're gonna
have to wait to find out what it is.

68
00:14:16,725 --> 00:14:18,031
Now, get on back there.

69
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,293
I'll be home soon.

70
00:15:40,678 --> 00:15:43,464
Sorry to come ridin' in on you.

71
00:15:47,642 --> 00:15:48,817
Is your mom or dad around?

72
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:55,128
Hey.

73
00:15:55,302 --> 00:15:57,304
Hope I'm not trespassing
or anything.

74
00:15:58,392 --> 00:15:59,959
Didn't know
anybody lived way out here.

75
00:16:02,396 --> 00:16:04,833
Been out for hours,
and I got all spun around. I..

76
00:16:05,007 --> 00:16:06,878
I can't find my way back
to the trail.

77
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:11,579
No signal out here anywhere.

78
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,843
Look, if you could just
point me toward..

79
00:16:15,017 --> 00:16:16,366
Help!

80
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,194
Please. Before he gets back.

81
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:20,109
What?

82
00:16:22,503 --> 00:16:23,765
What are we doing?

83
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:25,332
What are.. What are you doing?

84
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,898
Get on,
Helena. Whoa. Hang on.

85
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,552
- He'll be back soon.
- Who?

86
00:16:28,726 --> 00:16:30,641
- Please, we have to go. Now!
- I..

87
00:16:30,815 --> 00:16:32,469
- I don't wanna go!
- I can't just take you.

88
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm not even sure where we are.
That's why I'm..

89
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:42,871
No!

90
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,707
Mother! Mother, stop!

91
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:56,015
Mother! Mother, stop! Stop!

92
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:58,713
- Helena!
- No!

93
00:16:58,887 --> 00:16:59,844
Father!

94
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,588
Father!

95
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:06,503
Helena?

96
00:17:06,677 --> 00:17:08,027
- Father!
- Helena?

97
00:17:09,506 --> 00:17:10,725
No!

98
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,034
Stop! Stop!

99
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:29,222
Somebody!

100
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:32,616
Somebody!

101
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:34,200
Look who's awake.

102
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,506
It's okay, Helena.

103
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,727
Your mother's
just in the next room.

104
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:41,685
Where's my father?

105
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:45,298
He's not here. You're safe now.

106
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:47,343
There's nothing
to be afraid of anymore.

107
00:18:49,737 --> 00:18:50,825
Don't worry about that.

108
00:19:04,795 --> 00:19:05,796
Helena.

109
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:10,236
We shouldn't be here.
I want to go home.

110
00:19:11,367 --> 00:19:13,761
- That wasn't our home.
- What did you do?

111
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:17,939
What did you do?

112
00:19:18,113 --> 00:19:20,724
- I want Father.
- He can't be near us.

113
00:19:21,856 --> 00:19:23,074
Ever again.

114
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,861
He took me, Helena.

115
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,124
Jacob...

116
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,475
kidnapped me
and took me to the woods.

117
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,085
You're lying.

118
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:37,437
You're a liar.
You have always been a liar.

119
00:19:37,611 --> 00:19:38,829
Father told me.

120
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,877
Stop crying!

121
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:44,879
You're not allowed to do that.

122
00:19:45,053 --> 00:19:46,707
We need to let your mother rest.

123
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,665
Just for a few minutes.

124
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,842
We'll be okay. Helena?

125
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:55,341
Father?

126
00:21:12,227 --> 00:21:14,185
- Who's out?
- Yeah.

127
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,394
Okay, we have to go. Come on.

128
00:21:53,964 --> 00:21:55,531
You did good. Come on.

129
00:21:57,707 --> 00:22:00,057
Okay, let's go this way.

130
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,147
- There he is!
- Police! Don't move!

131
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,584
Are we gonna go home?

132
00:22:04,758 --> 00:22:05,846
One day we will.

133
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,674
Hey! Don't move!

134
00:22:11,242 --> 00:22:12,505
Back away from the girl.

135
00:22:12,809 --> 00:22:14,594
No!
On your stomach!

136
00:22:15,029 --> 00:22:16,117
Now!

137
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,771
He didn't do anything wrong.

138
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:19,773
Let me see your hands.

139
00:22:19,947 --> 00:22:22,863
I'll come find you,
Little Shadow.

140
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:25,126
He's running! I got him!

141
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,128
- Hands behind your back!
- Daddy!

142
00:23:32,236 --> 00:23:33,629
Shoot.

143
00:24:17,412 --> 00:24:19,109
No running, Marigold.

144
00:24:21,242 --> 00:24:23,418
Hi, sweetie.

145
00:24:23,723 --> 00:24:27,291
Mrs. Haver said she has a life of
her own, and if you're gonna be late,

146
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,946
she's gonna
start charging you rent for me.

147
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,514
She did,
huh? What does that mean?

148
00:24:32,688 --> 00:24:35,865
It means you are so valuable,
she thinks I should pay for you.

149
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,693
Whatcha got here?

150
00:24:37,954 --> 00:24:40,000
- My science project.
- It's a habitat. Uh-huh.

151
00:24:40,174 --> 00:24:42,785
Habitat? Who's the habitat for?

152
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,005
A baby deer.

153
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:49,444
It sleeps over here, beside the rocks,
to keep it safe from hunters.

154
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,011
Smart deer.

155
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:54,057
Mommy!

156
00:24:55,972 --> 00:24:57,278
What kind of leaf is this?

157
00:24:58,061 --> 00:24:59,454
A walnut.

158
00:24:59,628 --> 00:25:01,935
- From which tree?
- You tell me.

159
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:03,980
There.

160
00:25:04,154 --> 00:25:05,199
Mm-hmm.

161
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,331
And what's that tree?

162
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,681
A red oak.

163
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,683
It doesn't look red to me.

164
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:12,380
It will be in the fall.

165
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,816
Do you see the bird?

166
00:25:15,731 --> 00:25:17,124
A wood thrush.

167
00:25:17,298 --> 00:25:19,735
How do you know all the names?

168
00:25:19,909 --> 00:25:22,346
I can teach you if you want.

169
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,305
I can see a bunny rabbit.

170
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:26,307
Where?

171
00:25:26,481 --> 00:25:30,311
You have to kind of
tilt your head. See the ears?

172
00:25:30,485 --> 00:25:33,009
Oh, yeah. I see it.
With the tail down this way?

173
00:25:33,183 --> 00:25:34,228
Yeah.

174
00:25:37,666 --> 00:25:40,190
It means that we're one.

175
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:43,585
Family.

176
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:45,848
Mom?

177
00:25:47,415 --> 00:25:49,591
When can I have one of these?

178
00:25:49,765 --> 00:25:51,375
Not until you're 82 years old.

179
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,116
That's the rule, remember?

180
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,683
That's not fair.

181
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,859
You got them
when you were young.

182
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,862
I was much older than you,
and I wish I hadn't.

183
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,256
I like them.

184
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,431
I like you.

185
00:26:17,619 --> 00:26:19,229
Daddy's home!

186
00:26:21,536 --> 00:26:23,364
Put your stuff inside, sweetie.

187
00:26:23,538 --> 00:26:25,584
We're going to the campus
for Daddy's work picnic.

188
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:27,107
- Picnic?
- Sorry we're late.

189
00:26:27,324 --> 00:26:28,412
I forgot about
your thing tonight.

190
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,763
That's all right. Let's just go.

191
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:33,504
I have to change. Why don't you go
on over with her, and I'll come later.

192
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,419
Well, we've tried that.
You never show.

193
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:37,639
I'm just not good.
- At those things. - Neither am I.

194
00:26:37,813 --> 00:26:39,728
Which is why you're coming with.

195
00:26:39,902 --> 00:26:42,078
Plus, you're my beautiful wife,
and I want to show you off.

196
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,957
You know, it's funny.

197
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:52,959
Thank you.

198
00:26:53,133 --> 00:26:54,874
- Hey, you good?
- Yeah.

199
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,702
Is Marigold having fun?

200
00:26:56,876 --> 00:26:58,312
I don't know.
The crazy thing is,

201
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:00,183
my students don't even try
to hide it anymore.

202
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:02,185
Phones are going off
my entire lecture.

203
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,927
Well, in their defense,
I have heard some of your lectures.

204
00:27:08,322 --> 00:27:11,151
I love that. It's unusual.

205
00:27:11,325 --> 00:27:14,197
- Oh, thanks.
- Did you get it around here?

206
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:16,591
Uh, in San Francisco,
when I was a teenager.

207
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:19,638
You have a bunch of them.

208
00:27:19,812 --> 00:27:21,291
Too many.

209
00:27:21,465 --> 00:27:23,903
I didn't know
you're from San Francisco.

210
00:27:24,077 --> 00:27:27,341
Other places too. - We moved around a lot.
- What'd your parents do?

211
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:30,257
My father worked in insurance,
my mom sometimes did telemarketing.

212
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,825
Doesn't get much more boring
than that.

213
00:27:36,785 --> 00:27:39,396
"Then she took 20
mattresses and laid them on the pea."

214
00:27:39,570 --> 00:27:42,965
On this, the princess
had to lie all night.

215
00:27:43,139 --> 00:27:45,838
In the morning
she was asked how she had slept.

216
00:27:46,012 --> 00:27:47,448
And the princess said...

217
00:27:52,845 --> 00:27:54,716
"'‘Oh, very badly.'"

218
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:32,091
What's going on?
Where's my daughter?

219
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:33,092
Helena Erikkson?

220
00:30:33,266 --> 00:30:34,876
Where's Marigold?

221
00:30:35,094 --> 00:30:36,443
She's not here.
This isn't about her.

222
00:30:36,617 --> 00:30:38,532
I'm Special Agent Illing.

223
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:40,534
What are you doing in my house?

224
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:43,015
- Ms. Erikkson.
- My name is Pelletier.

225
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:45,800
Before that,
it was Jones, correct?

226
00:30:45,974 --> 00:30:48,629
Then Mitchell,
after you changed it from Bekkum.

227
00:30:48,803 --> 00:30:52,067
But you were born to Jacob
Holbrook and Beth Erikkson.

228
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:54,417
What do you want?

229
00:30:54,591 --> 00:30:57,116
Your father, Jacob Holbrook.

230
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,292
He and another prisoner
escaped last night

231
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,556
while being transported across
the state line to Alger Penitentiary.

232
00:31:03,470 --> 00:31:05,080
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

233
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:08,127
When I was ten years old.

234
00:31:08,301 --> 00:31:10,433
- Has he tried to contact you recently?
- No.

235
00:31:10,607 --> 00:31:12,218
Are you sure? Not even once?

236
00:31:12,479 --> 00:31:14,481
You could've called me.
You didn't need to come here.

237
00:31:14,655 --> 00:31:15,830
What's going on?

238
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,833
You okay?

239
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:20,530
Do you know where your father
might be going?

240
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,576
Y-Your father?

241
00:31:22,793 --> 00:31:24,839
You can't just
come into my house.

242
00:31:25,187 --> 00:31:27,015
Our warrant allows us to
check for any possible communication

243
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:28,756
to or from your father.

244
00:31:28,974 --> 00:31:30,801
Why do you keep saying that?
Helena's father..

245
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:32,629
He doesn't know where I live,
doesn't know my last name,

246
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:34,893
doesn't know anything about me.

247
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:37,112
And that's same for your
family and friends? Have any of your..

248
00:31:37,286 --> 00:31:39,680
I've never told anyone
Jacob Holbrook is my father.

249
00:31:42,074 --> 00:31:44,467
So, 20 years.

250
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:48,080
No letter,
birthday card, anything?

251
00:31:48,254 --> 00:31:49,081
No.

252
00:31:49,255 --> 00:31:50,778
I'm confused.

253
00:31:51,126 --> 00:31:52,432
I thought your parents died
in a car accident.

254
00:31:52,606 --> 00:31:54,956
That's what I told you.

255
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,176
And Holbrook, that's the Marsh
King guy. The one that just escaped.

256
00:31:57,350 --> 00:31:58,873
I heard it on the radio.

257
00:31:59,047 --> 00:32:01,528
That's right.

258
00:32:01,702 --> 00:32:03,182
Is there any risk
of him coming here?

259
00:32:03,356 --> 00:32:04,618
That's what we're trying
to find out.

260
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:06,620
He doesn't know where I live.

261
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:09,231
Oh,
you can't be too sure of that.

262
00:32:09,405 --> 00:32:11,320
Christ, Helena.
How could you not have told me?

263
00:32:12,321 --> 00:32:14,062
I told you to stay in the car, sweetie.

264
00:32:14,236 --> 00:32:16,935
- Who are these people?
- Police. They're just..

265
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,719
I'm gonna take her.
I'll call you later.

266
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,986
We're gonna need to see
your phone and any computers you use.

267
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,119
With any luck,
your father will be found soon.

268
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,078
You don't know my father.

269
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:34,300
If he makes it to the wild,
you'll never see him again.

270
00:32:34,517 --> 00:32:36,911
<i>In a case that received
nationwide notoriety,</i>

271
00:32:37,129 --> 00:32:40,175
<i>Jacob Holbrook, the so-called
"Marsh King," abducted Beth Erikkson</i>

272
00:32:40,393 --> 00:32:42,264
<i>and held her for 12 years</i>

273
00:32:42,438 --> 00:32:43,570
<i>in the wilderness
of Michigan's Upper Peninsula,</i>

274
00:32:43,787 --> 00:32:45,789
<i>until she eventually escaped</i>

275
00:32:46,225 --> 00:32:48,314
<i>with the daughter she gave
birth to while in captivity.</i>

276
00:32:48,488 --> 00:32:50,969
<i>After the trial, Erikkson had
difficulty adapting to normal life</i>

277
00:32:51,143 --> 00:32:53,232
<i>and was rarely seen in public.</i>

278
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:55,886
<i>Tragically, she died four years
ago in an apparent suicide.</i>

279
00:33:21,825 --> 00:33:23,305
<i>Yeah?</i>

280
00:33:23,479 --> 00:33:25,829
You guys coming home?

281
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,919
<i>I grabbed a hotel room
for the night. Mari's in the pool.</i>

282
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:32,967
I could bring her over
some school clothes, if you want.

283
00:33:33,141 --> 00:33:35,752
<i>I'm keeping her out tomorrow,
just in case.</i>

284
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:38,625
I didn't think
this would happen.

285
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:39,974
<i>That I'd find out?</i>

286
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:42,411
No. I mean, I wish I..

287
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:44,022
<i>Mari's yelling for me.
I gotta go.</i>

288
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,415
<i>Little Shadow.</i>

289
00:35:13,589 --> 00:35:15,156
Time to check our snares.

290
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:16,984
And a real hunter...

291
00:35:19,073 --> 00:35:21,119
needs a real knife.

292
00:35:24,644 --> 00:35:25,993
This is yours now.

293
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,692
Let's see how you do with it.

294
00:38:24,127 --> 00:38:25,172
Hi.

295
00:38:26,782 --> 00:38:29,089
I called earlier,
but you didn't answer.

296
00:38:30,003 --> 00:38:31,657
I'm not great with phones.

297
00:38:32,832 --> 00:38:34,094
That's an understatement.

298
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,792
I saw the news.

299
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:39,317
Thought I'd shoot down
and say hello.

300
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,928
Hello, Clark.

301
00:38:42,276 --> 00:38:45,279
Maybe grab a glass of water
before I head back.

302
00:38:59,989 --> 00:39:02,122
I know you
don't want me dropping in,

303
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,516
but I figured
everything's changed a bit now.

304
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,432
Cat's outta the bag.

305
00:39:07,606 --> 00:39:09,085
How's your husband taking it?

306
00:39:09,259 --> 00:39:10,652
Not well.

307
00:39:10,957 --> 00:39:13,220
He'll come around.
Just a matter of time.

308
00:39:14,874 --> 00:39:16,745
The little one's
not so little anymore.

309
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:20,706
Your mother
would've loved to have met her.

310
00:39:22,098 --> 00:39:25,058
I thought you might bring
Marigold up home a while back,

311
00:39:25,232 --> 00:39:27,277
at least for the funeral.

312
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:29,236
She wouldn't have
met her then either.

313
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,282
That's true enough.

314
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:34,546
Then, I guess I meant
I wish you woulda come sooner.

315
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,852
She would've liked that.

316
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:43,685
He still has that job
at the college?

317
00:39:45,687 --> 00:39:47,559
You still doing..Nothing's changed.

318
00:39:48,211 --> 00:39:50,257
Okay.

319
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,565
This is not how I saw this
playing out.

320
00:39:54,783 --> 00:39:58,047
I'm sorry,
I just can't do this right now.

321
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,144
Well,
at least it's not in the press.

322
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:12,105
No one's putting you with him.

323
00:40:12,279 --> 00:40:14,542
Just wanted to make sure you
weren't worried about things.

324
00:40:15,238 --> 00:40:16,805
I'm not.

325
00:40:19,591 --> 00:40:23,159
You know, there was a space
when you were about 13 or so.

326
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:27,294
I thought we had a shot at bein'
a nice little family, the three of us.

327
00:40:28,948 --> 00:40:30,645
It was never the three of us, Clark.

328
00:40:31,603 --> 00:40:33,735
She didn't want me around.

329
00:40:33,909 --> 00:40:35,824
When she looked at me,
she saw my father.

330
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,609
So did you.

331
00:40:38,218 --> 00:40:39,698
No.

332
00:40:39,872 --> 00:40:41,439
You're forgetting
some good days.

333
00:40:42,788 --> 00:40:44,006
She loved you.

334
00:40:45,268 --> 00:40:46,313
I still love you.

335
00:40:48,010 --> 00:40:49,011
I miss you.

336
00:40:51,536 --> 00:40:54,321
But sure, maybe sometimes
we saw a little Jacob in you.

337
00:40:56,279 --> 00:40:58,368
Or maybe you never saw
enough of him in me.

338
00:41:05,941 --> 00:41:08,857
You here to relieve this
fella? No, I'm supposed to..

339
00:41:09,031 --> 00:41:12,557
Mrs. Pelletier, the FBI would
like you to come down to the office.

340
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:13,993
Did something come up?

341
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,342
Way above my pay grade.

342
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,084
You want me to come with you?

343
00:41:19,781 --> 00:41:21,609
We found your father's body.

344
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:25,091
Just inside the state line.

345
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:28,137
We assume they were heading
for a crossing to Canada.

346
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,705
Guard rail, 60 feet up on the
embankment was splintered.

347
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:33,142
Driver either lost control
or fell asleep.

348
00:41:33,316 --> 00:41:35,580
The car hit a tree
and caught fire.

349
00:41:35,754 --> 00:41:38,234
Both men were burned
beyond recognition.

350
00:41:38,408 --> 00:41:41,194
We think they had an accomplice.
We're looking for him now.

351
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:44,240
How can you be sure
it's Holbrook?

352
00:41:48,462 --> 00:41:52,248
He has three gold teeth with
carvings matching your father.

353
00:41:58,777 --> 00:41:59,778
You all right?

354
00:42:03,129 --> 00:42:04,696
My father died 20 years ago.

355
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,166
Mmm.

356
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,604
I'm sorry about your daddy.

357
00:42:43,778 --> 00:42:46,041
We saw it on TV.

358
00:42:46,215 --> 00:42:49,479
Thank you, sweetie,
but he wasn't my daddy for a long time.

359
00:42:49,654 --> 00:42:52,482
We brought you some food
in case you didn't wanna cook.

360
00:42:53,483 --> 00:42:56,095
Let me guess, extra pepperoni?

361
00:42:56,269 --> 00:42:59,054
- I'm definitely in the mood for pizza.
- Yes!

362
00:43:02,797 --> 00:43:04,016
How you doing?

363
00:43:04,669 --> 00:43:05,757
I'm fine.

364
00:43:09,804 --> 00:43:12,241
I wish you would've told me
the truth.

365
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:15,723
What's the worst
that could've happened?

366
00:43:17,638 --> 00:43:19,988
- We wouldn't have Mari.
- You don't know that.

367
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,904
Yes, I do.

368
00:43:23,078 --> 00:43:26,647
Who in their right mind would
get involved with the daughter...

369
00:43:26,821 --> 00:43:30,869
If you knew my name was Holbrook,
you'd never have gone on a date with me.

370
00:43:31,043 --> 00:43:32,740
You would've run the other way.

371
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,569
- You will now.
- Hold on.

372
00:43:37,223 --> 00:43:40,182
Let's pretend that I'm a better
person than you think I am, all right?

373
00:43:40,356 --> 00:43:42,271
What's the best thing
that could've happened?

374
00:43:43,316 --> 00:43:45,927
You might've found
somebody to trust.

375
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:50,366
Someone to help you through
all the shitty days.

376
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,934
Somebody to explain
all your weird tattoos to.

377
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,247
The best never happens, Stephen.

378
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:03,684
No matter how badly we want it.

379
00:44:26,228 --> 00:44:28,013
- Marigold okay?
- Yeah.

380
00:44:28,187 --> 00:44:29,275
She's asleep.

381
00:44:30,885 --> 00:44:32,147
Do you really believe that?

382
00:44:34,933 --> 00:44:36,369
What you said before about...

383
00:44:38,414 --> 00:44:39,851
the best never happening.

384
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:44,246
Because if you do,
what's that mean for us?

385
00:44:47,293 --> 00:44:51,558
Look I.. I don't wanna
make this any worse for you.

386
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,126
But you gotta let me in, Helena.

387
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:02,874
Okay, look. I'm gonna go
do some work at the office.

388
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:06,529
Probably sleep over there.

389
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:54,012
My name is Helena Holbrook.

390
00:45:56,666 --> 00:45:58,756
Remember the guy
who kidnapped that woman?

391
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:02,194
The one everybody called
The Marsh King?

392
00:46:04,152 --> 00:46:05,240
I'm his daughter.

393
00:46:11,986 --> 00:46:16,599
Sometimes I sneak off alone
at night because I feel trapped.

394
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,778
Like I can't figure out
which world I really belong in.

395
00:46:26,871 --> 00:46:29,525
I have trouble trusting
people because...

396
00:46:31,179 --> 00:46:34,617
everyone tells me the
person I believed in the most

397
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:36,837
was really a monster.

398
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:44,540
He gave me this
after my first kill.

399
00:46:55,247 --> 00:46:56,770
And this one when I missed.

400
00:47:00,078 --> 00:47:01,949
This is the place
he taught me to swim.

401
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:10,958
The name he gave me.

402
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,572
This to remind me never to wait
to do my chores.

403
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:25,016
These were the only tears
my father ever wanted to see.

404
00:47:30,412 --> 00:47:32,632
Would you like to go out
on a date with me?

405
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,533
Come on. I
know. I can do it.

406
00:48:04,707 --> 00:48:06,927
I have been looking forward
to this day.

407
00:48:07,101 --> 00:48:09,364
Thought it was time to
introduce you to a couple people.

408
00:48:09,538 --> 00:48:11,584
Look, Daddy,
they have horses.

409
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:15,066
This is Clark. He's gonna try his
best to get you to call him Grandpa.

410
00:48:15,240 --> 00:48:16,763
Make him earn it.

411
00:48:16,937 --> 00:48:18,983
That doesn't scare me a bit.

412
00:48:19,157 --> 00:48:20,810
I've got no one else
to spend it on.

413
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:23,291
It is very nice to meet you, Marigold.

414
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,684
You too, Clark.

415
00:48:26,338 --> 00:48:27,730
I'm gonna like this one.

416
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,907
Would you like
to see the horses?

417
00:49:30,054 --> 00:49:31,577
Who's getting hungry?

418
00:49:41,804 --> 00:49:43,676
Two hours after I took that,

419
00:49:43,850 --> 00:49:46,287
I started getting calls
that some hoodlum

420
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:49,029
was setting off fireworks
in people's yards.

421
00:49:49,203 --> 00:49:52,293
She tore that dress to shreds,
running from one of my deputies.

422
00:49:52,467 --> 00:49:54,339
You can stop now.

423
00:49:54,513 --> 00:49:56,384
Oh, hell, we haven't even got
to your difficult stage yet.

424
00:49:56,558 --> 00:49:58,082
Who's that?

425
00:50:00,606 --> 00:50:02,347
That's your grandmother.

426
00:50:04,392 --> 00:50:05,872
You definitely take after her.

427
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:10,137
I don't remember that picture.

428
00:50:10,311 --> 00:50:12,052
It looks like us.

429
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:20,321
You know, I wouldn't complain
if this became a habit.

430
00:50:28,416 --> 00:50:29,417
Thank you, Clark.

431
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,202
Anytime.

432
00:50:32,203 --> 00:50:33,813
Hey.

433
00:50:34,074 --> 00:50:37,164
You know,
Jacob took a lot of my people's beliefs,

434
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:40,515
twisted 'em
to fit what suited him.

435
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:46,913
Means "owned" in Ojibwa.
Not "family."

436
00:50:47,914 --> 00:50:48,958
Don't confuse the two.

437
00:51:19,772 --> 00:51:21,948
Sh..

438
00:51:54,937 --> 00:51:56,243
Little Shadow.

439
00:52:11,606 --> 00:52:12,738
What's wrong?

440
00:52:17,482 --> 00:52:19,832
I'm just getting some water.

441
00:54:28,526 --> 00:54:32,312
Hey, make sure you wipe
your feet when you come in the house.

442
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:33,531
I did.

443
00:54:34,662 --> 00:54:35,968
I'll drop her on the way.

444
00:54:36,621 --> 00:54:38,144
See you after.

445
00:54:38,449 --> 00:54:40,233
- We'll go swimming or something.
- Don't forget my goggles.

446
00:54:40,407 --> 00:54:42,583
I got that conference
in Detroit this afternoon.

447
00:54:42,757 --> 00:54:43,758
Might be home late.

448
00:54:45,238 --> 00:54:46,239
- You gonna be okay?
- Mmm.

449
00:54:57,859 --> 00:54:58,860
Thank you.

450
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,432
Helena?

451
00:55:05,606 --> 00:55:06,825
How you doing?

452
00:55:07,695 --> 00:55:09,436
Good. Fine.

453
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,395
Are you guys
around this weekend?

454
00:55:11,569 --> 00:55:14,006
I was thinking Jess and Marigold
could have a playdate.

455
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:17,662
Oh, yeah. I think we're free,
just...

456
00:55:22,101 --> 00:55:24,625
Sorry. Yeah, she'd love that.

457
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,236
How's Saturday? Would she
like to come over to our place?

458
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:30,501
Of course. She has swim
until 10:00 but after that...

459
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,993
Can you hold on a second? Sorry.

460
00:57:02,897 --> 00:57:05,030
You're not helping.

461
00:57:05,204 --> 00:57:08,816
I'm not supposed to help.
This is your homework, not mine.

462
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:10,296
But you always help.

463
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,298
Well, you can figure this out.

464
00:57:12,472 --> 00:57:15,432
Why are you in a bad mood again?

465
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:17,042
I'm not.

466
00:57:18,304 --> 00:57:19,566
I don't mean to be.

467
00:57:21,046 --> 00:57:24,005
Let's go read. We'll get Daddy
to help us finish in the morning.

468
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,790
- Okay?
- Okay.

469
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:32,797
"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool"

470
00:57:32,971 --> 00:57:35,756
like a carpet patterned
with flowers.

471
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:39,194
And on this carpet,
lay a young and beautiful woman.

472
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:44,678
The mother cried, '‘Is this myself
I see, reflected in your eyes?'

473
00:57:44,852 --> 00:57:46,245
"And the daughter said..."

474
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:51,772
Hey, daughter?
You missed your entrance.

475
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,506
<i>Helena.</i>

476
00:58:41,866 --> 00:58:43,998
- What is it?
- It's a doll.

477
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:47,567
You.. You play with it.

478
00:58:48,655 --> 00:58:49,656
Like a friend.

479
00:58:56,489 --> 00:58:57,490
She has hair like me.

480
00:58:58,926 --> 00:59:00,101
A tiny Helena.

481
01:00:24,838 --> 01:00:26,057
Oh, God.

482
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:29,582
Marigold!

483
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:35,283
Helena!

484
01:00:35,457 --> 01:00:36,720
Hey, it's me.

485
01:00:37,111 --> 01:00:38,112
It's me.

486
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:42,421
Jesus. What are you...

487
01:00:42,595 --> 01:00:45,467
Uh... I..Whose blood is that?

488
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,819
No one's. A rabbit.
I heard somebody outside.

489
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:50,777
Maybe try calling the police

490
01:00:51,082 --> 01:00:53,606
instead of running around
in the dark with a knife.

491
01:00:53,780 --> 01:00:57,566
- I have to check on Marigold.
- Marigold's fine. She's asleep.

492
01:00:57,741 --> 01:00:58,872
I just left her room.

493
01:00:59,699 --> 01:01:00,831
Did you see anyone out there?

494
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:05,357
Hey.

495
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,751
We're gonna keep the doors locked,
all right?

496
01:01:07,925 --> 01:01:09,448
Get a few cop cars on patrol.

497
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:13,147
It's gonna be okay.

498
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:45,614
<i>It was bleeding
from the head.</i>

499
01:01:45,789 --> 01:01:48,922
Like someone killed it first,
then put it in the snare.

500
01:01:50,228 --> 01:01:53,057
Or maybe it got injured
some other way.

501
01:01:53,231 --> 01:01:57,496
What's got you spooked? Why do
you think there's something more?

502
01:01:57,670 --> 01:02:00,020
I feel like he's here.

503
01:02:00,194 --> 01:02:02,893
<i>The night you found us,</i>

504
01:02:03,067 --> 01:02:04,721
<i>when we came out of the woods,</i>

505
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:07,332
I was so afraid
because he wasn't there with me.

506
01:02:09,247 --> 01:02:10,378
But then he came.

507
01:02:10,552 --> 01:02:12,163
Don't get lost in this, Helena.

508
01:02:12,337 --> 01:02:14,208
<i>Now he's come back again.</i>

509
01:02:14,382 --> 01:02:17,037
<i>I have to tell him
to leave us alone.</i>

510
01:02:17,211 --> 01:02:20,040
You have got to try to get him
out of your head.

511
01:02:20,214 --> 01:02:21,346
For good.

512
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:23,696
I'm not sure
I can do that.

513
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,437
How could he be alive?

514
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:27,221
I don't know.

515
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,188
<i>There's nothing purer
than the instinct to survive.</i>

516
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:02,039
Mommy!

517
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:08,045
Marigold?

518
01:03:10,874 --> 01:03:12,745
I couldn't find my backpack.

519
01:03:15,879 --> 01:03:17,750
Oh, no, no, no. That stays here.

520
01:03:18,882 --> 01:03:20,535
I wanna show people.

521
01:03:20,709 --> 01:03:22,581
Let's wait a while on that, okay?

522
01:03:22,755 --> 01:03:23,974
Okay.

523
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:35,507
Where did you get those?

524
01:03:35,681 --> 01:03:38,336
I thought you made them.
I like them.

525
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,120
Looks like you and me.

526
01:03:51,479 --> 01:03:53,873
Has the habitat been in
your room the whole time?

527
01:03:55,048 --> 01:03:56,136
Mm-hmm.

528
01:04:13,806 --> 01:04:15,025
What are you doing?

529
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:25,905
Come on.

530
01:04:30,605 --> 01:04:32,912
<i>Stay inside
after school unless Daddy</i>

531
01:04:33,304 --> 01:04:37,134
<i>or I are here, okay? Don't go with
anyone else, no matter what they say.</i>

532
01:05:02,986 --> 01:05:04,335
What's this about?

533
01:05:04,509 --> 01:05:05,902
Just felt like it.

534
01:05:06,206 --> 01:05:08,687
<i>Can you pick Marigold up
after school?</i>

535
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:10,863
<i>Of course.</i>

536
01:05:11,516 --> 01:05:12,517
<i>Why?</i>

537
01:05:14,345 --> 01:05:17,174
<i>I have to do something.
I can't tell you what it is.</i>

538
01:05:23,702 --> 01:05:25,269
<i>What's going on, Helena?</i>

539
01:05:27,097 --> 01:05:30,448
<i>I know I haven't
given you any reason to...</i>

540
01:05:32,145 --> 01:05:33,538
<i>please trust me.</i>

541
01:05:35,061 --> 01:05:36,367
<i>I'll call you when I get back.</i>

542
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:38,804
<i>Back from where?</i>

543
01:05:40,545 --> 01:05:41,807
<i>Last secret, Stephen.</i>

544
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:44,070
<i>Promise.</i>

545
01:06:04,699 --> 01:06:06,658
You and Mari rescued me.

546
01:08:11,478 --> 01:08:13,263
<i>I can call it anything I want?</i>

547
01:08:13,437 --> 01:08:15,917
It's yours.
I gave it to you.

548
01:08:20,008 --> 01:08:21,140
I name it

549
01:08:22,228 --> 01:08:23,664
Helena Falls.

550
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,270
Hello, Little Shadow.

551
01:11:16,097 --> 01:11:17,751
Let's go for a walk.

552
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,815
How did you find me?

553
01:11:37,989 --> 01:11:39,773
I never lost you, Little Shadow.

554
01:11:51,785 --> 01:11:53,309
I miss that smell.

555
01:11:56,790 --> 01:11:58,052
And the taste.

556
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:03,014
Gimme that.

557
01:12:15,548 --> 01:12:16,941
My favorite knife.

558
01:12:39,572 --> 01:12:41,574
We used to come camping up here,
you remember?

559
01:12:42,749 --> 01:12:45,578
We'd lay out here
all summer long.

560
01:12:45,752 --> 01:12:47,145
Look up at the sky,

561
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:48,668
see who could count
the most shooting stars.

562
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:51,584
I used to cheat
and count airplanes.

563
01:12:55,675 --> 01:12:59,070
You knew I was alive the whole time,
didn't you?

564
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:01,725
I didn't know
how it was possible.

565
01:13:02,987 --> 01:13:05,250
Not until I saw
a three-legged coyote.

566
01:13:07,034 --> 01:13:09,210
Sacrificed its own leg
for freedom.

567
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:11,561
Like you sacrificed your teeth.

568
01:13:11,735 --> 01:13:13,693
Ah.

569
01:13:13,867 --> 01:13:16,087
Probably won't pass
a medical exam,

570
01:13:16,261 --> 01:13:18,176
but it bought you
the time you needed.

571
01:13:20,004 --> 01:13:21,397
You did some digging.

572
01:13:22,267 --> 01:13:23,747
Well done.

573
01:13:29,274 --> 01:13:31,450
You didn't tell anyone else
your theory?

574
01:13:33,713 --> 01:13:34,932
Did you?

575
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:42,243
Wish you'd brought Marigold.

576
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:45,595
Tell me about my granddaughter.

577
01:13:45,769 --> 01:13:49,381
I don't think so. You know
enough about her already.

578
01:13:53,124 --> 01:13:54,604
Well, I had to take a peek.

579
01:13:57,084 --> 01:13:58,869
You never brought her
to visit me.

580
01:14:00,827 --> 01:14:02,438
You didn't visit me at all.

581
01:14:07,007 --> 01:14:08,313
Come on, Little Shadow.

582
01:14:08,487 --> 01:14:09,880
I want to show you something.

583
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:15,886
You know,
Marigold looks like her.

584
01:14:16,669 --> 01:14:17,670
Your mother.

585
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:20,847
I bet she loves the water
as much as we do.

586
01:14:25,939 --> 01:14:27,767
That's to take us
across the border.

587
01:14:28,594 --> 01:14:29,726
The three of us.

588
01:14:31,031 --> 01:14:32,859
To Canada,
we can be a family again.

589
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:35,035
I have a family.

590
01:14:35,209 --> 01:14:36,384
You have a daughter.

591
01:14:36,559 --> 01:14:37,647
And a husband.

592
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:39,736
We've built a life together.

593
01:14:41,085 --> 01:14:42,390
Are you happy with that life?

594
01:14:44,828 --> 01:14:46,177
Not always.

595
01:14:46,438 --> 01:14:48,179
Do you ever think
back to what it was like

596
01:14:48,788 --> 01:14:49,920
when we lived here?

597
01:14:50,268 --> 01:14:53,489
- I do.
- We can have it all again.

598
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:59,233
I remember
when you were four years old,

599
01:14:59,407 --> 01:15:01,192
you could shut your eyes

600
01:15:02,759 --> 01:15:06,589
and you knew where you were
from the sound of the water,

601
01:15:06,763 --> 01:15:09,896
from the smell of the trees,

602
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:14,205
and the feel of the ground
beneath your feet.

603
01:15:14,379 --> 01:15:15,989
It was like magic.

604
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,125
This is where we belong.

605
01:15:21,299 --> 01:15:23,170
It's our home.

606
01:15:23,823 --> 01:15:25,129
Our life here

607
01:15:26,217 --> 01:15:27,392
was perfect.

608
01:15:40,579 --> 01:15:41,711
No!

609
01:15:46,672 --> 01:15:47,804
No!

610
01:15:52,330 --> 01:15:54,593
Don't you ever run away
from me again!

611
01:15:55,246 --> 01:15:56,682
Okay? You hear me?

612
01:16:01,252 --> 01:16:02,427
I wasn't..

613
01:16:10,261 --> 01:16:11,305
Perfect?

614
01:16:13,177 --> 01:16:14,178
Not for my mother.

615
01:16:14,831 --> 01:16:16,310
Well, it could've been.

616
01:16:16,484 --> 01:16:17,616
How?

617
01:16:18,791 --> 01:16:22,273
- You kidnapped her.
- No. We ran away together.

618
01:16:22,447 --> 01:16:25,755
That's just something she said
when she decided to leave.

619
01:16:25,929 --> 01:16:28,453
- You shot that man.
- I was trying to hit the engine.

620
01:16:28,627 --> 01:16:29,628
You never would have missed.

621
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,762
I missed.

622
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:36,243
You've been told a
bunch of stories about me.

623
01:16:36,417 --> 01:16:40,160
They're not true. I never was the
Marsh King, until they said I was.

624
01:16:42,946 --> 01:16:44,643
I know this, we were happy.

625
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:46,906
You were happy.

626
01:16:48,865 --> 01:16:51,432
All I'm saying, bring Marigold,
let her see for herself.

627
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:52,999
I can't do that.

628
01:16:54,174 --> 01:16:55,480
I won't.

629
01:16:57,134 --> 01:16:58,701
I'm sorry.
This is where it ends.

630
01:17:01,094 --> 01:17:02,966
I shouldn't have come here.

631
01:17:06,186 --> 01:17:07,797
I'm glad I did.

632
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:14,978
Now I have to go home
to my family.

633
01:17:15,848 --> 01:17:18,590
Please don't come
near them again.

634
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:22,115
- It doesn't need to be like this.
- It does.

635
01:17:27,164 --> 01:17:28,382
Okay.

636
01:17:29,035 --> 01:17:30,167
Okay.

637
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:31,864
I understand.

638
01:17:40,177 --> 01:17:41,874
You'll always be
my Little Shadow.

639
01:17:46,096 --> 01:17:47,445
I have to go.

640
01:18:24,351 --> 01:18:25,396
Clark?

641
01:18:27,137 --> 01:18:30,140
- What are you doing here?
- Could ask you the same thing.

642
01:18:30,314 --> 01:18:32,620
Stephen called me.
He was worried.

643
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:35,406
And I just had a hunch
after what you said.

644
01:18:37,103 --> 01:18:40,411
- Is he here?
- Let's go back. I'll tell you on the way.

645
01:18:40,585 --> 01:18:43,153
Helena, was he here?

646
01:18:44,937 --> 01:18:46,025
But he's gone.

647
01:19:01,301 --> 01:19:02,955
Clark. Clark.

648
01:19:03,129 --> 01:19:05,828
Clark. Oh, God. Oh, God.

649
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:10,702
Clark, look at me, okay?

650
01:19:10,876 --> 01:19:12,748
Clark. Clark, stay with me.

651
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:16,055
You told him. - You were coming here?
- No, I didn't say anything.

652
01:19:16,490 --> 01:19:17,665
Please, look at me.

653
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:19,755
Clark, I'm right here.

654
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:23,410
Clark, hold on.
Please, Clark, hold on.

655
01:19:23,584 --> 01:19:25,499
You must've said something.

656
01:19:25,673 --> 01:19:27,501
Make your stepfather curious.

657
01:19:27,675 --> 01:19:30,591
Enough to wander out here
all this way by himself.

658
01:19:30,766 --> 01:19:32,985
Just get away from us.
What have you done?

659
01:19:35,161 --> 01:19:37,033
Please, Clark. Please. Come on.

660
01:19:37,642 --> 01:19:39,078
Come on. Please.

661
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:41,559
Well, there's nothing you can do
to help him now.

662
01:19:46,694 --> 01:19:48,044
No!

663
01:19:48,218 --> 01:19:50,307
You'd rather the wolf lived
than us?

664
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:54,833
You want it to feed you
to its pup?

665
01:19:56,052 --> 01:19:58,141
Now I have to get Marigold
on my own.

666
01:19:58,315 --> 01:20:00,665
No! Don't you touch her!

667
01:20:10,501 --> 01:20:13,025
We can still all be a family.

668
01:20:13,591 --> 01:20:14,722
It's all I want.

669
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:17,508
I'll be back with Marigold soon.

670
01:20:17,682 --> 01:20:19,336
No! No, no.

671
01:20:21,425 --> 01:20:22,469
No!

672
01:20:23,514 --> 01:20:24,558
No!

673
01:21:05,730 --> 01:21:06,862
Helena.

674
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:18,874
Wrap the rope around you.

675
01:21:21,224 --> 01:21:22,747
Did he say I could come up?

676
01:21:22,965 --> 01:21:25,228
I don't care,
I'm getting you out of there.

677
01:21:32,713 --> 01:21:34,585
I've got you, my Helena.

678
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,718
You're gonna be fine.

679
01:21:39,329 --> 01:21:41,287
Because you're stronger than me.

680
01:21:42,941 --> 01:21:44,029
Braver than me.

681
01:23:25,783 --> 01:23:27,045
Please.

682
01:23:30,222 --> 01:23:31,441
Clark.

683
01:23:43,105 --> 01:23:44,845
I'm so sorry.

684
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,601
I'll come back for you.

685
01:25:05,448 --> 01:25:07,667
<i>All rivers bend, Helena.</i>

686
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:46,086
<i>Is the blood warm
or cold?</i>

687
01:27:47,262 --> 01:27:48,350
- Cold.
<i>- Cold.</i>

688
01:27:48,698 --> 01:27:51,048
<i>Then you must move faster.</i>

689
01:28:33,699 --> 01:28:35,353
<i>Running or walking?</i>

690
01:28:39,966 --> 01:28:41,359
<i>Running.</i>

691
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:45,320
<i>And if you were afraid,</i>

692
01:28:45,494 --> 01:28:47,147
<i>running for your life,</i>

693
01:28:47,931 --> 01:28:49,324
<i>where would you run?</i>

694
01:28:54,633 --> 01:28:56,548
<i>To where no one could see me.</i>

695
01:29:10,432 --> 01:29:12,085
You know what you taught me.

696
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:11,901
You're fine,
it's just a flesh wound.

697
01:31:12,554 --> 01:31:13,555
Now...

698
01:31:14,469 --> 01:31:16,296
what good will it do Marigold

699
01:31:16,471 --> 01:31:20,213
if her mother is lying rotting
in the bottom of the marsh?

700
01:31:20,866 --> 01:31:22,259
She needs you.

701
01:31:23,913 --> 01:31:26,263
Just think about
what's best for your daughter.

702
01:31:26,437 --> 01:31:27,482
Okay?

703
01:31:28,178 --> 01:31:29,788
No!

704
01:31:31,311 --> 01:31:32,661
No!

705
01:31:34,227 --> 01:31:37,448
The boat you came in. Show me.

706
01:32:22,449 --> 01:32:23,494
Go on.

707
01:32:25,757 --> 01:32:27,933
I waited my whole life
to see you again.

708
01:32:30,066 --> 01:32:32,721
I wasn't sure what I would feel
when I did.

709
01:32:32,895 --> 01:32:35,201
- What do you feel, Little Shadow?
- Don't call me that.

710
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:36,376
Not anymore.

711
01:32:38,030 --> 01:32:40,424
I used to think you said it
because I was always beside you.

712
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:44,036
Now I realize you just meant,

713
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:47,474
like any shadow, I wouldn't
exist if you weren't standing there.

714
01:32:47,649 --> 01:32:50,390
Your mother did a job on you
after I was gone.

715
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,044
No, she didn't.

716
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:54,873
I barely spoke
to her my whole life.

717
01:32:56,179 --> 01:32:59,008
I blamed her for everything too.
I never believed her.

718
01:32:59,182 --> 01:33:03,795
You really think she cared about
you the way I care about you?

719
01:33:03,969 --> 01:33:06,102
She wouldn't have a gun on me.

720
01:33:08,844 --> 01:33:10,280
She could have run.

721
01:33:11,455 --> 01:33:12,717
Gotten away.

722
01:33:14,110 --> 01:33:15,677
She stayed to protect me.

723
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,811
Now I know,
she was the strong one.

724
01:33:19,985 --> 01:33:21,508
She was weak.

725
01:33:21,683 --> 01:33:22,771
No.

726
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:28,167
A man who drags a woman
into the wilderness is weak.

727
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:30,996
Careful, Little Shadow.

728
01:33:33,259 --> 01:33:38,351
You forget all the things
that I did for you.

729
01:33:39,222 --> 01:33:42,225
The years I spent in a cage

730
01:33:42,399 --> 01:33:45,141
'cause I came back for you.

731
01:33:46,098 --> 01:33:48,448
What would you do for Marigold?

732
01:34:01,679 --> 01:34:03,028
I'd die for her.

733
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:34,843
Daddy!

734
01:34:41,110 --> 01:34:43,068
Come on. Come on.

735
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:32,335
<i>"Water lilies spread
over the surface of the pool</i>

736
01:35:32,509 --> 01:35:35,207
<i>like a carpet patterned
with flowers.</i>

737
01:35:35,381 --> 01:35:40,082
<i>And on this carpet lay
a strong and beautiful woman.</i>

738
01:35:40,256 --> 01:35:46,566
The mother cried, '‘Is this myself
I see, reflected in your eyes?'

739
01:35:46,741 --> 01:35:48,220
"And the daughter said..."

740
01:35:49,178 --> 01:35:50,570
"Is it me I see,

741
01:35:52,007 --> 01:35:53,617
mirrored in yours?"

742
01:35:53,878 --> 01:35:57,186
"Then the child rose
in the shape of a mighty swan

743
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:59,579
and spread her powerful wings."

744
01:36:58,421 --> 01:36:59,901
I don't hate you.

745
01:37:01,641 --> 01:37:03,165
I don't pity you.

746
01:37:03,339 --> 01:37:05,384
I just remember your lesson.

747
01:37:07,386 --> 01:37:09,171
Always protect my family.
